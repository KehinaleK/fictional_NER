elvish_6,Namárië - Altariello nainië Loriendessë In Tengwar,"Ai! Laurië lantar lassi súrinen,

Namárië! Nai hiruvalyë Valimar,
Nai elyë hiruva. Namárië! ",Farewell - Galadriel's Lament in Lórien,"Ah! Like gold fall the leaves in the wind,
long years numberless as the wings of trees!
The years have passed like swift draughts
of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West,
beneath the blue vaults of Varda
wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly.

Who now shall refill the cup for me? 

For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of the Stars,
from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds,
and all paths are drowned deep in shadow;
and out of a grey country darkness lies
on the foaming waves between us,
and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever.
Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar

Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar.
Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell! ",,0

the fairest daughter of the People of Horses,
you are light like the Sun on sky;
you are crowned by long golden hair,
shining like the bright rays of light,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You fell in the love with him;
you want his love, young princess.
Arwen is in the heart of Elessar;
he is a man and a bold warrior;
you love him but he does not love you,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

The darkness has come; they depart
to fight in a war in far lands,
and you they left at home:
they want you to watch women, children
in the fortresses in the high mountains,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

You want to find an end to your grief;
under the name of Dernhelm now you go
secretly like a [lit. the] normal horseman;
in the gray eyes a halfling saw
someone without hope who wants to die
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Under his dead horse lies the king
who was like a father to you and to your brother;
having a sword in your hands you are looking at
a terrible monster carrying fear;
a living man will not stop the Lord of corpses,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Éowyn, you are not a man, you are a woman;
he is strong, evil, dark and large,
rules over fear and Sauron over him;
you lifted a sword high,
his crown fell, he is fallen,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You wanted to die and have glory;
you fought the Lord of the Úlairi,
and he is dead but now you lie
beside your king, you do not see him;
you do not hear his last words,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You are sick and sorrowful by life;
an old woman speaks old wisdom:
the hands of the king heal.
Éowyn, they bore for you only life,
but not joy and desire to exist,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

The love of a minister you found;
he walked and talked together with you
between trees and flowers in his home;
he said to you that he loves you;
now you are healed by love
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Now you will not rule as [or, like] the queen;
you will be a healer like him;
not a shieldmaiden and not a princess,
you will love everything alive and fair;
as he will love you, you will love him

",In a winter's day,"From my home to the street
I walk in a cold winter's day,
under shadowy-grey skies,
the sun hidden by clouds.

I hear the cold Northwind
blowing through the leafless trees,
whispering in the twisted branches,
sounding like a Death-lament. 

The clamour of the Northwind fades,
and from the West I smell a
fragrant Zephyr blowing towards me,
and the lament changes to song. 

I see a swallow flying
from the South, the hot wind
under its sickle-shaped wings
singing towards the leafless trees. 

The clouds pass, and I see
the Sun setting in the West,
and from the East the Moon rises,
and in the twilight the star shines. 

And by the song of the nightingale
I return to whence I came,
under the starlit heavens,
in this winter's evening. ",Vicente Velasco,1

",Genesis (Chapitre 1),"In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. 

The Earth was [*né] void and empty, and there was darkness upon [or, over] the abyss, but the Spirit of God hovered above the waters.

And God said, ""There be light!"" and there was light. 

God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it became evening, and it became morning, the first day. 

And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and it shall separate water from water."" 

And God made the firmament and separated the waters above the firmament from the waters below the firmament. And it was so. 

And God called the firmament Heaven. And it became evening, and it became morning, the second day.

And God said: ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered in one place, and let the dry land appear!"" and it was so.  

And God called the dry land Earth, but the waters [that were] gathered he called Sea. And God saw that it was good. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bear [forth] grass, plants making seeds, fruit-trees bearing [forth] fruit according to their kinds, in the earth."" and it was [became? remained?] so. 

The earth bore grass, plants making seeds, according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which their seeds are, according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And it became evening, and it became morning, the third day.  

And God said: ""Let there be lights [or, lamps] on the firmament of the heavens to separate day from night, and they will be signs of times and days and years. 

They will be lights on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth."" and it was [became?] so. 

God made the two great lights, the greatest light to rule at day and the lesser [pitya, ""small""] light to rule at night, and the stars.

And God placed them on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth.  

and to rule by day and by night and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fourth day. 

And God said: ""Let there be a swarm [úvë = ""abundance""] of living creatures in the waters, and let birds fly in the firmament of the heavens."" 

And God created the great animals of the sea and the whole abundance of living creatures that move in the waters, after their kinds, and all winged creatures after their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God blessed them and said, ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the water of the oceans, and the birds shall be many in the earth [lit. ""be the birds numerous on earth]!""  

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fifth day. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bring forth [lit. bear] living creatures according to their kinds, beasts and insects and the wild animals of the earth, according to their kinds."" 

And God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds, and the beasts according to their kinds and all animals that walk the earth [cemendë, locative], according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God said: ""Let us make Man in our image, shaped like us; and he shall rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts and all the earth and all animals that walk the earth."" 

And God created Man in his image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 

And God blessed them, and God said to them: ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the earth and subdue it [place it under you], and rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and all living creatures that walk the earth.""

And God said: ""Behold! I give you all plants making seeds, all there are on the entire surface of the earth, and all trees making fruits in which there are seeds. It is what you will eat. 

And to all wild animals and all the birds of heaven and to everything that walks the earth, to all that lives, I give all green plants to eat.""

And God saw all that he [had] made, and behold! it was very good. And it became evening, and it became morning, the sixth day.",,1

 ",Into the West,"Lay down your sweet and weary head
Night is falling; you have come to journey's end
Sleep now and dream of the ones who came before
They are calling from across a distant shore
Why do you weep? What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms, you're only sleeping

What can you see on the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the Sea a pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn to silver glass
A light on the water, all souls pass

Hope fades into the world of night
Through shadows falling out of memory and time
Don't say we have come now to the end
White shores are calling, you and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms, just sleeping
 
What can you see on the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the Sea a pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn to silver glass
A light on the water, grey ships pass

",Quenta Silmarillion Fragment: 'Of the beginning of days',"In the beginning of the days 

It is said within the wise ones that the firts of the wars began before the creation of Arda was achieved, before nothing had walked or grown on the surface of the Earth, and long Melkor was victorious.

But in the middle of this war, a courageous and powerful spirit came like a support to the Valar, from the end of the sky knowing the battle in the Little Earth, and Arda resounded by the echoes of his laugh.

Thus came Tulkas the Strong, his rage is like rage of the sky preceeded by dark clouds.
Melkor gone away from his joyful fury and abandonned Arda, and peace long lasted.

Tulkas abode on the Earth and was like the Valar of Arda, and Melkor stood in the outer Darkness.

His hatred of Tulkas was everlasting.
In this time, the Valar shaped the seas and the lands and the mountains, then Yavanna sowed the seeds she had create a long time ago.

Then, for the fires were controled or abandonned under the firts hills, the light was lacking.


By the request of Yavanna, Aule carried in the middle of the seas two large lamps he had made, for them to ligh the Middle Earth.


Varda filled them, Manwe lighted them and the Valar fixed them upon large pillars, higher than all the montagne that remained for us.

The first was raised in the North of Middle earth, its name was Illuin, the second in the south, Ormal, and the light of the Valar's lamps covered down the earth where everything shined like a day with no end.

'Then, the seeds sowed by Yavanna springed and sprouted swiftly, a crowd of things great and little raised on the earth, herbs and mosses and tall ferns, and tress crowned by clouds like living mountains which roots dived in the green twilight.'


'Animals came and dwelled in the valleys, in the rivers and in the lakes, and gone through the shade of the forests.'

'No flower had sprouted yet, no bird had sung, for these things waited for their hour in the heart of Yavanna, but she had though of abundance, and nowhere more rich (than) in the middle of the Earth, where the rays of the two lamps met and jointed.'

'In the great lake, on the isle of Almaren, in the time everything was new, in the time the new greenness was like an enchantment to the eyes of its creators, the Valar made their first dwelling, and longtime were fully happy about that.'

'It happened in this time that the Valar rested from their labours and looked at the growth and the expansion of the things they had though then created, Manwe established a great fest to which the Valar and their host came by his call.

'But Aule and Tulkas were lessened, for they served everybody by the skills of the first and the strenght of the second, pauseless and restless.


'And Melkor knew everything made, having secretly friends and spies within the Maiar which had fallen under his law.'

'Far away in the Darkness, he was hateful, greedy toward the works of his brothers which he had wanted under his authority.'

'Then out of the outermost limits of Ea he gethered the spirits kept for his service and he though he was strong.'


'Thinking his hour come, he approached toward Arda, he looked at it by his eyes and the vision of the Earth in its spring filled him with a new hatred.'

She took the silver dews from the vats of Telperion, and therewith she made new stars and brighter against the coming of the Firstborn; wherefore she whose name out of the deeps of time and the labours of Ea was Tintallë, the Kindler, was called after by the Elves Elentári, Queen of the Stars.

 ",Quenta Silmarillion Fragment: 'Of the ruin of Beleriand',"Battle Between Fingolfin and Morgoth

Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed-him to) the full downfall [of] the Noldor, and the downfall beyond repair [of] all houses-their; and from wrath and despair Rochallor-upon great horse-his got-he and departed alone and none were able to stop-him.  Passed-he over [the] Anfauglith like [a] wind in the dust, and all that beheld issuing-his departed thinking Oromë himself was come; for great rage was him-upon so eyes-his shone like the eyes the Valar-of.  And so came-he to Angband’s gates and sounded-he horn-his, and beat again upon the doorway and dared Morgoth to single war.  And Morgoth came.

That was the last time in those wars that passed-he the doorway [of] stronghold-his, and it is said that he answered not the dare [of] free will; but yet might-his was greatest [of] all things in this world alone [of] the Valar fear-he knew.  But-he could not deny the dare in front [of] commanders-his; for the stones rang from the high-music [of] Fingolfin’s horn, and voice-his came keen and clean down to the deeps [of] Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven and lord [of] slaves.  And so Morgoth came, ascending slowly from-his underground throneand the sound [of] feet-his was like [the] noise of a storm underground. And forth-issued-he clad in black armour; and stood before [the] King like [a] tower, iron-crowned, and might shield-his, token not carven, cast a shadow over him like [a] dark cloud.  But Fingolfin gleamed

Then Morgoth raised Grond [the] Hammer [of] Hell, and thrust it down like lightning.  But Fingolfin sprang away, and Grond rent [a] mighty pit in the earth, wherein mist and fire danced.  Many times Morgoth essayed to beat-him and each time Fingolfin leaped away, like lightning from under [a] dark cloud; and wounded-he Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave [a] shout [of] agony whereat the hosts of Angband fell on their faces in fear; and the shouts in the Northlands.

But then the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down shield-his-upon-him.  Three times crumbled down he was, and three times rose again and bore up broken shield-his and cloven helmet.  But the earth was all rent and pitted all round him, and fell-he backward-before the feet [of] Morgoth; and Morgoth set-his left foor on neck-his, and the burden [of] it was like [a] small hill.  And yet with final and hopeless stroke-his Fingolfin hewed, the foot with Ringil, and the blood forth-flooded black and smoking and filled the pits [of] Grond.

Like this died Fingolfin, High King [of the] Noldor, most brave and valiant [of the] Elven-kings [of] old.  The orcs made no festival [of] the war before the gate; and the Eldar sing not [of] it for sadness-theirs extends deep.

Account of the Valar and Maiar according to the lore of the Eldar. 
In the beginning Eru, the One, who in the Elvish tongue is named Ilúvatar, made the Ainur of his thought: and they made a great Music before him. In this Music the World was begun; for Ilúvatar made visible the song of the Ainur, and they beheld it as light in the darkness. And many among them became enamoured of its beauty, and of its history which they saw beginning and unfolding as in a vision. Therefore Ilúvatar gave to their vision Being, and set it amid the Void, and the Secret Fire was sent to burn at the heart of the World; and it was called Eä. Then those of the Ainur who desired it arose and entered into the World, at the beginning of Time; and it was their task to achieve it, and by their labours to fulfil the vision which they had seen. Long they laboured in the regions of Eä, which are vast beyond the thought of Elves and Men, until in the time appointed was made Arda, the Kingdom of Earth. Then they put on the raiment of Earth and descended into it, and dwelt therein ",Translated by Ryszard Derdzinski,1

",THE LAY OF LEITHIAN,"I. Of Thingol In Doriath
A king there was in days of old:
ere Men yet walked upon the mould
his power was reared in caverns' shade,
his hand was over glen and glade.
Of leaves his crown, his mantle green,
his silver lances long and keen;
the starlight in his shield was caught,
ere moon was made or sun was wrought.
In after-days, when to the shore
of Middle-earth from Valinor
the Elven-hosts in might returned,
and banners flew and beacons burned,
when kings of Eldamar went by
in strength of war, beneath the sky
then still his silver trumpets blew
when sun was young and moon was new.
Afar then in Beleriand,
in Doriath's beleaguered land,
King Thingol sat on guarded throne
in many-pillared halls of stone:
there beryl, pearl, and opal pale,
and metal wrought like fishes' mail,
buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
and gleaming spears were laid in hoard:
all these he had and counted small,
for clearer than all wealth in hall,
and fairer than are born to. Men,
a daughter had he, Lúthien. 

Of Lúthien the Beloved 

Such lissom limbs no more shall run
on the green earth beneath the sun;
so fair a maid no more shall be
from dawn to dusk, from sun to sea.
Her robe was blue as summer skies,
but grey as evening were her eyes;
her mantle sewn with lilies fair,
but dark as shadow was her hair.
Her feet were swift as bird on wing,
her laughter merry as the spring;
the slender willow the bowing reed,
the fragrance of a flowering mead,
the light upon the leaves of trees,
the voice of water, more than these
her beauty was and blissfulness,
her glory and her loveliness. ",Translated by Diego Sebastian Bao and Tandra Chu,1

glittering light of the numberless stars

‘Behold!’

- in music our speech was born,

when our hearts were turned towards the West.

 

Happiness and bliss of Eldamar

drowned under the waves of fire and blood.

In frosty gloom of Helcaraxë

we hardened our hearts,

homeless and exiled.

 

Either Beleriand under the shadow of the iron-crown,

or in the icy and deadly light of the Silmarils,

our only hope is alliance with the Followers.

Blood poured over of the immortal and the mortals

flows with one river of the numberless years.

 

Silmarils, glory and... sin;

Bitter is this war – victory so distant;

And the Sea summons again.

Warmth has passed from the world. Stop, my legs! No more today.
The dust swirls above my head, my sinews shake a bit,
both rest then. The Sun crumbles, and floats tired beyond the mountains.
Stars icily glitter in the sky with their cruel light.
A sad vision of my self long years ago (or was it ages?)
trembles in the air among the trees. I shut my eyes.
It is enough to see the end of the journey all the time. It dangles
in the rear of my mind every day. Rest,
my mind, rest! Nothing remains but resolve.
They say, the Elves praise the stars. I myself dread
their endless glare, for my will collapses
under that cold perfection. The words, my message
to utter have abandoned me when the first faint glitter
of fear fell on my head. The dire message,
to tell the Valar that life is defeated, all
the Elves are gone, the Dwarves lie dead
deep under rocks too heavy to heave,
and countless Morgoths have arisen. Perhaps
it is proper that my tongue is knotted
for when I say the words, the roots of the world
will surely crumble crying, and the Void covers all.

But alas! still
the ship waits there in that harbour far away, that
I will never find. Or so it seems.

And wind [is] brow-on;
When walk [is] long and breath deep,
And keen mountain air;
Come back to me!
Come back to me and say my land is fair!

And seed [is] earth-in;
When blossom like shining snow,
Orchard cover;
When spring rain and Sun,
Fill air fragrance-with;
Stay-I here and not come-will-I
Because land-my is fair!

Ent: When Summer lies world-upon,
And noon-in gold-of;
Beneath roof leaves-of sleeping,
Dreams trees-of blossom;
When woodland halls are,
Green and cool and wind [is] West-in,
Come back to me!
Come back to me and say land-my is best!

Wife Ent-of: When Summer warms hanging fruit,
And burn brown berry;
When straw is gold and ear is white,
And harvest comes village-to;
When honey flow, and apple swells,
With wind West-in;
Stay-I here beneath Sun,
Because land-my is best!

Ent: When Winter come-will,
Winter wild, that hill and wood slay-will;
When trees fall-will,
And starless night eat-will sunless day;
When wind [is] deadly Wind-in,
Then beneath bitter rain;
Look-will-I [at] you, and call-will-I you,
Again-come-I you-to!

And singing end-will;
When darkness fall-will end-in,
When broken barren branch,
And light and labour past-will;
Look-will-I [at] you,
And wait-will-I you-for,
Until meet-will-we again:

From the last ship of the Noldor, lost

The last mariner, chosen by the fate
released from the cool waves of Osse,
to the life out of the waters on the gray shore
by the Lord of the Waters was given back

You know this place, and its mountains,
you knew everything in the prosperous days.
But Vinyamar old of stone made
is empty and gone those who dwelled here.

To the secret realm they are gone,
in order to hide, hidden off the shadow from the North
to have safety in unsafe time,
untill the doom puts the end to the supposed hope.


But not all [the] hope is lost forever,
and the anger of the Mighty is not without end.
Above the malice of Quendi is their faithfullness
that is now brought out of the cruel sea.


Look up, raise your heart,
come again into the shadow of the Middle Earth,
who is coming against you in the gray cloak,
is nobody of the Elven-folk sons.

Through the mortal Man the hope [is] given
through the mortal it is coming, in the cold winter,
but the spring shall come to the Middle Earth,
and the Star of [the] Hope shall be kindled.

John was wrapped in a cloak of hairs of camels and had a leather-belt around his hips, and his food was grasshoppers and wild honey. 5 Then Jerusalem and all of Judea and the entire land surrounding Jordan went out to him, 6 and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

7 When he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees come to the baptism, he said to them: “Offspring of serpents, who taught you to escape from the coming wrath? 8 Then bear fruit worthy of the repentance! 9 And do not think that you may say to yourselves: 'Our father is Abraham' – for I say to you that God can rise up children to Abraham from these stones. 10 Even now the ax is lying by the roots of the trees: Thus every three that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 11 I baptize you with water, into repentance. But [the one] that comes after me is mightier than I – I am not worthy to take the shoes from his feet. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and with fire. 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will cleanse his threshing floor.

Ar pantanes antorya ar peantane te, quetila:",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 5,"Seeing the crowds he went up into the mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him. 2 And he opened his mouth and instructed them, saying:

3 “Happy are the lacking ones in spirit, for they will possess the kingdom of heaven!

4 Happy are the ones that have grief, for they shall be comforted!

5 Happy are the gentle ones, for they shall be heirs of earth!

6 Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!

7 Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.

31 It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce. But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

43 You have heard that [it] is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy! 44 But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you, 45 for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.

46 If you love [those] who love you, what is your reward? Do not the tax collectors do the same thing?

3 “Happy are the lacking ones in spirit, for they will possess the kingdom of heaven!

4 Happy are the ones that have grief, for they shall be comforted!

5 Happy are the gentle ones, for they shall be heirs of earth!

6 Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!

7 Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.

31 It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce. But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

43 You have heard that [it] is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy! 44 But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you, 45 for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.

31 It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce. But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

43 You have heard that [it] is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy! 44 But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you, 45 for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.

46 If you love [those] who love you, what is your reward? Do not the tax collectors do the same thing?

6 Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!

7 Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.

31 It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce. But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

43 You have heard that [it] is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy! 44 But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you, 45 for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.

46 If you love [those] who love you, what is your reward? Do not the tax collectors do the same thing?

47 And if you greet only your brothers, how is this a great thing? Do not people of the nations do the same?

Mal inye quete lenna in ilquen ye yéta nís milyala se, yando tá arácie vestale óse endaryasse.",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 5,"Seeing the crowds he went up into the mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him. 2 And he opened his mouth and instructed them, saying:

3 “Happy are the lacking ones in spirit, for they will possess the kingdom of heaven!

4 Happy are the ones that have grief, for they shall be comforted!

5 Happy are the gentle ones, for they shall be heirs of earth!

6 Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!

7 Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.

31 It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce. But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

43 You have heard that [it] is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy! 44 But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you, 45 for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.

46 If you love [those] who love you, what is your reward? Do not the tax collectors do the same thing?

3 “Happy are the lacking ones in spirit, for they will possess the kingdom of heaven!

4 Happy are the ones that have grief, for they shall be comforted!

5 Happy are the gentle ones, for they shall be heirs of earth!

6 Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!

7 Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you.

Truly I say to you: They are receiving their whole reward. 3 But you, when you give gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. 4 Thus your gifts of mercy will be in secret; then your father, who is watching in secret, will reward you.

5 Therefore, when you [pl.] pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray when they are standing on the corners of the roads, in order to be visible to men. 6 Truly I tell you: They are receiving their entire reward. 7 But you [sg.], when you pray, go into your own chamber, and after closing your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who is secretly watching, will pay you. 7 But when you are praying, do not say the same things in monotonous repetition, as people of the [heathen] nations do, for they think that they will be being heard by using numerous words. 8 Therefore, do not be like them, for God your [pl.] Father know your needs before you request [anything] from him.

9 Pray, then, thus: Our Father in heaven, holy be your name! 10 Let your kingdom come! Let your will be done on earth as in heaven! 11 Give us today our daily bread, 12 and forgive us our sins as we forgive them to them that sin against us. 13 Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil! Amen!

14 If you forgive men their crimes, your Father in heaven will also forgive you; 15 but if you do not forgive men, your Father will in the same manner not forgive your crimes to you.

16 When you [pl.] keep a fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who make their face disfigured in order to make their fast visible to men. Truly I say to you: They are receiving their entire reward. 17 But you [sg.], when you keep a fast, put oil on your head and wash your face. 18 Thus your fasting will not be visible to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who secretly is watching, will pay [/reward] you.

Are you not more important than them? 27 Who among you can add a single cubit to his life? 28 Furthermore, concerning clothes, what is your reason for being troubled?

Truly I say to you: They are receiving their whole reward. 3 But you, when you give gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. 4 Thus your gifts of mercy will be in secret; then your father, who is watching in secret, will reward you.

5 Therefore, when you [pl.] pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray when they are standing on the corners of the roads, in order to be visible to men. 6 Truly I tell you: They are receiving their entire reward. 7 But you [sg.], when you pray, go into your own chamber, and after closing your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who is secretly watching, will pay you. 7 But when you are praying, do not say the same things in monotonous repetition, as people of the [heathen] nations do, for they think that they will be being heard by using numerous words. 8 Therefore, do not be like them, for God your [pl.] Father know your needs before you request [anything] from him.

9 Pray, then, thus: Our Father in heaven, holy be your name! 10 Let your kingdom come! Let your will be done on earth as in heaven! 11 Give us today our daily bread, 12 and forgive us our sins as we forgive them to them that sin against us. 13 Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil! Amen!

14 If you forgive men their crimes, your Father in heaven will also forgive you; 15 but if you do not forgive men, your Father will in the same manner not forgive your crimes to you.

16 When you [pl.] keep a fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who make their face disfigured in order to make their fast visible to men. Truly I say to you: They are receiving their entire reward. 17 But you [sg.], when you keep a fast, put oil on your head and wash your face. 18 Thus your fasting will not be visible to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who secretly is watching, will pay [/reward] you.

19 Do not gather for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and erosion devour, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But gather for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and erosion do not devour, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

22 Your body's lamp is the eye. Therefore, if your eye is in health, your entire body will be bright, 23 but if your eye is wicked, your entire body will be dark. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great the darkness is!

24 It is not possible for anyone to be slave for two lords; he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and loathe the other. You cannot be slaves for God and for Mammon alike.

25 Therefore I say to you: Do not be troubled about yourselves, about what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies, concerning the clothers you will wear.  Is the life not more than food and the body than the clothes? 26 Notice the birds of heaven, that they do not sow or reap or gather into barns [haurar, stores], and yet your heavenly Father gives them food. Are you not more important than them? 27 Who among you can add a single cubit to his life? 28 Furthermore, concerning clothes, what is your reason for being troubled? Learn from [or 'by', -nen] the lilies of the field, how they do not labour and do not twine [threads], 29 but I tell you that Solomon in his glory was not clad as a single [one] among them. 30 If God so adorns the plants in the field, that exist today and will be gone tomorrow, how much more richly will he cover you, you of little faith? 31 Therefore, do not be troubled and say: “What will we eat?” or “With what are we to cover ourselves?” 32 For all these things the nations pursue. But your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.

33 Seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. 34 Therefore, do not be troubled about the following day, for the following day will have its own troubles. Every day's evil suffices for it.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will keep fasts. 16 [There] is not anyone who fastens a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for its full power will pull from it, and there will be a worse tearing. 17 Furthermore, [there] is not anyone who puts new wine in old skin-bottles, but if one does do so, the skin-bottles are ruptured and the wine pours out and the skin-bottles are destroyed. But people put new wine in new skin-bottles, and both remain!”

18 While he told them these things, behold! a ruler came near and bowed to him, saying: “My daughter died a little while ago, but come and put your hand on her, and she will return to life!”

19 Then Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples. 20 And behold! a woman having a flood of blood for [ter, through] twelve years came behind him and touched the rim of his cloak, 21 for she said to herself: “If only I touch his cloak I shall be saved!” 22 Jesus turned and, noticing her, said: “Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you!” And from that time the woman had health.

23 When he came to the house of the ruler and saw the flute-players and the crowd making clamour, 24 Jesus said: “Go away from here, for the maiden did not die, but she is asleep. Then they laughed at him with scorn. 25 After he sent the crowd outside he entered and took her hand, and the maiden arose. 26 And this story went out to that entire region.

27 When Jesus passed along from there, two blind men followed him, crying and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”  28 After he entered the house, the sightless ones came to him, and Jesus said to them: “Do you believe that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord!” 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying: “May it happen to you as you believe!” 30 And their eyes were opened. Furthermore, Jesus firmly commanded them, saying: “See that you do not let anyone know it!” 31 But they, when they went outside, told about him to in that entire region.

The crowds marvelled and said: “A thing like this has not ever been seen in Israel!” 34 But the Pharisees said: “By the lord of the demons he throws out the demons!”

35 And Jesus went in a circuit to all the cities and villages, instructing in their synagogues and making known the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and every kind of ailment. 36 When he saw the crowds, his heart went out to them, for they were naked and scattered like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is great, but [those] who work are few.

But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will keep fasts. 16 [There] is not anyone who fastens a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for its full power will pull from it, and there will be a worse tearing. 17 Furthermore, [there] is not anyone who puts new wine in old skin-bottles, but if one does do so, the skin-bottles are ruptured and the wine pours out and the skin-bottles are destroyed. But people put new wine in new skin-bottles, and both remain!”

18 While he told them these things, behold! a ruler came near and bowed to him, saying: “My daughter died a little while ago, but come and put your hand on her, and she will return to life!”

19 Then Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples. 20 And behold! a woman having a flood of blood for [ter, through] twelve years came behind him and touched the rim of his cloak, 21 for she said to herself: “If only I touch his cloak I shall be saved!” 22 Jesus turned and, noticing her, said: “Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you!” And from that time the woman had health.

23 When he came to the house of the ruler and saw the flute-players and the crowd making clamour, 24 Jesus said: “Go away from here, for the maiden did not die, but she is asleep. Then they laughed at him with scorn. 25 After he sent the crowd outside he entered and took her hand, and the maiden arose. 26 And this story went out to that entire region.

27 When Jesus passed along from there, two blind men followed him, crying and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”  28 After he entered the house, the sightless ones came to him, and Jesus said to them: “Do you believe that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord!” 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying: “May it happen to you as you believe!” 30 And their eyes were opened. Furthermore, Jesus firmly commanded them, saying: “See that you do not let anyone know it!” 31 But they, when they went outside, told about him to in that entire region.

32 Now, when he went away, behold! people brought him a dumb man possessed by a demon, 33 and after the demon was thrown out, the dumb man spoke. The crowds marvelled and said: “A thing like this has not ever been seen in Israel!” 34 But the Pharisees said: “By the lord of the demons he throws out the demons!”

35 And Jesus went in a circuit to all the cities and villages, instructing in their synagogues and making known the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and every kind of ailment. 36 When he saw the crowds, his heart went out to them, for they were naked and scattered like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is great, but [those] who work are few.

9 And going away from there Jesus saw a man sit at the tax office, called Matthew, and he said to him: “Follow me!” And that one arose and followed him. 10 Thereafter, while he lay by the table in the house, behold! many tax collectors and sinners came and lay there with Jesus and his disciples. 11 But seeing that, the Pharisees were saying to his disciples: “How is [it] that your teacher eats with the tax collectors and sinners? 12 Hearing it, he said: “People in health do not have [any] need of a healer, but the ailing ones [do]. 13 Go and learn what this means: I want mercy and not sacrifice.

2 [The] names of the twelve disciples are these: First Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, 3 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, Jacob the brother of Alpheus and Thaddeus, 4 Simon the Cananean and Judas Iscariot, who after gave him over.

5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these commands: “Do not go on the road to the [gentile] nations, and do not come into a Samaritan city. 6 Instead [i mende 'in the place'], go to the lost sheep from the house of Israel! 7 While you go, make known the message, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'

In every city or village into which you come, find out who in it is worthy, and remain there until you go away. 12 When you come into the house, greet it, 13 and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you. 14 Whenever anyone does not receive you or listens to your words, when you go away form that house or from that city, shake the dust from your feet [dual]. 15 Truly I say to you: The Day of Judgement will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for that city!

16 Behold! I send you like sheep among wolves. Therefore be intelligent like serpents and guiltless like doves. 17 Watch yourselves against men, for they will give you over to tribunals and will flay you in their synagogues. 18 You will be led before governors and kings concernin me, as a witness to them and to the nations. 19 But when they give you over, do not be troubled about how or what you are to say, for [that] which you are to say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For [the ones] that speak are not only you, but your Father's Spirit that speaks by you. 21 Furthermore, brother will give brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against their parents [dual] and will cause their [dual] death. 22 And you will be hated by all concerning my name, but who endures to the end, he will he saved. 23 When they pursue you in this city, flee to another, for truly I say to you: By no means will you complete the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man shall come.

24 A disciple is not above [the one] who instructs him, or a slave above his lord. 25 It suffices for the disciple if he becomes like [the one] who instructs him, and the slave like his lord. If people called the householder Beelzebul, how much more will they call the people of his house so?

26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. 27 [That] which I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and [that] which you hear being whispered, make it known from the tops of the houses. 28 And not do fear [those] those that kills the body but cannot kill the soul; sooner [or, rather] fear [the one] that can undo soul and body alike in Gehenna. 29 But are not two sparrows sold for a piece of copper? And yet one among them [dual] does not fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But also [or, even] all the hairs on your head are counted. 31 Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.

32 Therefore everyone that confesses me before men, I as well will confess before my father who is in heaven; 33 but anyone that denies me before men, I as well will deny before my Father who is in heaven. 34 Do not think that I have come to put peace on earth; I have not come to put peace [here], but a sword. 35 For I came to cause splits: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against the mother of her husband; 36 and a man's enemies are the people of his house. 37 If a person's father or mother is dearer to him than I [am], he is not worthy of me; and if a person's son or daughter is dearer to him than me, he is not worthy of me. 38 And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me. 39 [The] one that finds his life, to him it shall be lost, but the person whose life becomes lost for my sake [lit. for my good], will find it.

5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these commands: “Do not go on the road to the [gentile] nations, and do not come into a Samaritan city. 6 Instead [i mende 'in the place'], go to the lost sheep from the house of Israel! 7 While you go, make known the message, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal sick ones, raise dead ones, cleanse skin-diseased ones, throw out demons! You have received [it] for nothing, give [it] for nothing! 9 Do not put gold or silver or copper in your belt 10 or bring a food-pouch for the journey, or two tunics, or shoes or a staff, for [the one] who works is worthy of his food.

In every city or village into which you come, find out who in it is worthy, and remain there until you go away. 12 When you come into the house, greet it, 13 and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you. 14 Whenever anyone does not receive you or listens to your words, when you go away form that house or from that city, shake the dust from your feet [dual]. 15 Truly I say to you: The Day of Judgement will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for that city!

16 Behold! I send you like sheep among wolves. Therefore be intelligent like serpents and guiltless like doves. 17 Watch yourselves against men, for they will give you over to tribunals and will flay you in their synagogues. 18 You will be led before governors and kings concernin me, as a witness to them and to the nations. 19 But when they give you over, do not be troubled about how or what you are to say, for [that] which you are to say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For [the ones] that speak are not only you, but your Father's Spirit that speaks by you. 21 Furthermore, brother will give brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against their parents [dual] and will cause their [dual] death. 22 And you will be hated by all concerning my name, but who endures to the end, he will he saved. 23 When they pursue you in this city, flee to another, for truly I say to you: By no means will you complete the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man shall come.

24 A disciple is not above [the one] who instructs him, or a slave above his lord. 25 It suffices for the disciple if he becomes like [the one] who instructs him, and the slave like his lord. If people called the householder Beelzebul, how much more will they call the people of his house so?

26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. 27 [That] which I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and [that] which you hear being whispered, make it known from the tops of the houses. 28 And not do fear [those] those that kills the body but cannot kill the soul; sooner [or, rather] fear [the one] that can undo soul and body alike in Gehenna. 29 But are not two sparrows sold for a piece of copper? And yet one among them [dual] does not fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But also [or, even] all the hairs on your head are counted. 31 Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.

32 Therefore everyone that confesses me before men, I as well will confess before my father who is in heaven; 33 but anyone that denies me before men, I as well will deny before my Father who is in heaven. 34 Do not think that I have come to put peace on earth; I have not come to put peace [here], but a sword. 35 For I came to cause splits: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against the mother of her husband; 36 and a man's enemies are the people of his house. 37 If a person's father or mother is dearer to him than I [am], he is not worthy of me; and if a person's son or daughter is dearer to him than me, he is not worthy of me. 38 And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me. 39 [The] one that finds his life, to him it shall be lost, but the person whose life becomes lost for my sake [lit. for my good], will find it.

40 [He] that receives you receives also me, and [he] that receives me receives also the one who sent me. 41 [The one] that receives a prophet since he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and [the one] that receives a just man since he is just, will receive a just man's reward. 42 And anyone that gives to a person among these small ones only a cup of cold water since he is a disciple – truly I say to you, his reward will by no means be lost to him.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1
