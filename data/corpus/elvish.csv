the fairest daughter of the People of Horses,
you are light like the Sun on sky;
you are crowned by long golden hair,
shining like the bright rays of light,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You fell in the love with him;
you want his love, young princess.
Arwen is in the heart of Elessar;
he is a man and a bold warrior;
you love him but he does not love you,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

The darkness has come; they depart
to fight in a war in far lands,
and you they left at home:
they want you to watch women, children
in the fortresses in the high mountains,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

You want to find an end to your grief;
under the name of Dernhelm now you go
secretly like a [lit. the] normal horseman;
in the gray eyes a halfling saw
someone without hope who wants to die
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Under his dead horse lies the king
who was like a father to you and to your brother;
having a sword in your hands you are looking at
a terrible monster carrying fear;
a living man will not stop the Lord of corpses,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Éowyn, you are not a man, you are a woman;
he is strong, evil, dark and large,
rules over fear and Sauron over him;
you lifted a sword high,
his crown fell, he is fallen,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You wanted to die and have glory;
you fought the Lord of the Úlairi,
and he is dead but now you lie
beside your king, you do not see him;
you do not hear his last words,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You are sick and sorrowful by life;
an old woman speaks old wisdom:
the hands of the king heal.
Éowyn, they bore for you only life,
but not joy and desire to exist,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

The love of a minister you found;
he walked and talked together with you
between trees and flowers in his home;
he said to you that he loves you;
now you are healed by love
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Now you will not rule as [or, like] the queen;
you will be a healer like him;
not a shieldmaiden and not a princess,
you will love everything alive and fair;
as he will love you, you will love him
Éowyn bride healer. ",Ales Bican

",In a winter's day ,"From my home to the street
I walk in a cold winter's day,
under shadowy-grey skies,
the sun hidden by clouds.

I hear the cold Northwind
blowing through the leafless trees,
whispering in the twisted branches,
sounding like a Death-lament. 

The clamour of the Northwind fades,
and from the West I smell a
fragrant Zephyr blowing towards me,
and the lament changes to song. 

I see a swallow flying
from the South, the hot wind
under its sickle-shaped wings
singing towards the leafless trees. 

The clouds pass, and I see
the Sun setting in the West,
and from the East the Moon rises,
and in the twilight the star shines. 

And by the song of the nightingale
I return to whence I came,
under the starlit heavens,
in this winter's evening. ",Vicente Velasco

",Genesis (Chapitre 1),"In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. 

The Earth was [*né] void and empty, and there was darkness upon [or, over] the abyss, but the Spirit of God hovered above the waters.

And God said, ""There be light!"" and there was light. 

God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it became evening, and it became morning, the first day. 

And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and it shall separate water from water."" 

And God made the firmament and separated the waters above the firmament from the waters below the firmament. And it was so. 

And God called the firmament Heaven. And it became evening, and it became morning, the second day.

And God said: ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered in one place, and let the dry land appear!"" and it was so.  

And God called the dry land Earth, but the waters [that were] gathered he called Sea. And God saw that it was good. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bear [forth] grass, plants making seeds, fruit-trees bearing [forth] fruit according to their kinds, in the earth."" and it was [became? remained?] so. 

The earth bore grass, plants making seeds, according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which their seeds are, according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And it became evening, and it became morning, the third day.  

And God said: ""Let there be lights [or, lamps] on the firmament of the heavens to separate day from night, and they will be signs of times and days and years. 

They will be lights on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth."" and it was [became?] so. 

God made the two great lights, the greatest light to rule at day and the lesser [pitya, ""small""] light to rule at night, and the stars.

And God placed them on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth.  

and to rule by day and by night and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fourth day. 

And God said: ""Let there be a swarm [úvë = ""abundance""] of living creatures in the waters, and let birds fly in the firmament of the heavens."" 

And God created the great animals of the sea and the whole abundance of living creatures that move in the waters, after their kinds, and all winged creatures after their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God blessed them and said, ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the water of the oceans, and the birds shall be many in the earth [lit. ""be the birds numerous on earth]!""  

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fifth day. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bring forth [lit. bear] living creatures according to their kinds, beasts and insects and the wild animals of the earth, according to their kinds."" 

And God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds, and the beasts according to their kinds and all animals that walk the earth [cemendë, locative], according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God said: ""Let us make Man in our image, shaped like us; and he shall rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts and all the earth and all animals that walk the earth."" 

And God created Man in his image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 

And God blessed them, and God said to them: ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the earth and subdue it [place it under you], and rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and all living creatures that walk the earth.""

And God said: ""Behold! I give you all plants making seeds, all there are on the entire surface of the earth, and all trees making fruits in which there are seeds. It is what you will eat. 

And to all wild animals and all the birds of heaven and to everything that walks the earth, to all that lives, I give all green plants to eat.""

And God saw all that he [had] made, and behold! it was very good. And it became evening, and it became morning, the sixth day.",

",Genesis (Chapitre 2),"Thus heaven and earth and all of their army were completed [lit. finished].

And on the seventh day God concluded his work that he [had] made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he [had] made.  

And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, for on it God rested from all his work that he (had) created and made.

This is the story of heaven and earth when they were created, on the day that Jehovah God made heaven and earth. 

There was not yet any bush on the field on earth, and plants still did not grow, for Jehovah God [had] not made rain fall upon earth, and there was no man to cultivate [lit. work on] the field.

But a mist rose from the earth, and it gave water to the entire surface of the earth. 

And Jehovah God made the man out of dust from the earth and breathed [/blew] life-breath into his nose, and the man was [/became] a living creature. 

And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, toward the East, and there he placed the Man that he [had] made.

And Jehovah God made grow from the earth every tree that is beautiful to look upon [cenien, ""for seeing"", dative] and good to eat from [lit. ""good for eating from it""], and also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil.  

There was a river that went out from Eden to give water to the garden, and from there it was parted into four streams. 

The name of the first [river] is Pishon [Hebrew: Pîshôn]; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Havíla [Chawîlâ], where there is gold. 

And the gold of that land is good. There are also fragrant gum and onyx stone. 

And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Cush. 

And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is the one that goes east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

And Jehovah God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it [lit. work in it] and watch [over] it

But from the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil do not eat, for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die. 

And Jehovah God said: ""It is not good that the man is lonely. I will make him a helper that is like him."" 

Jehovah God made out of earth all the animals of the field and all the birds of heaven, and he lead them to the man to see what he called [/would call] them. What [lit. (that) which] the man called any living creature, it was (to be) its name. 

And the man named all the beasts and the birds of heaven and all wild animals, but for Man he did not find a helper that was like him.

Then Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and filled [up] with flesh.

And Jehovah God made the rib that he took from the man into a woman, and he lead her to the man. 

Then the man said: ""This time it is bones of my bones and flesh of my flesh! This one will be called Woman, for from Man she was taken."" 

Therefore [lit. thus] a man will leave [lit. pass from] his father and his mother and stick to his wife, and they will be(come) one flesh. 

They were naked, the man and his wife, but they were not ashamed. ",Helge Kare Fauskanger
