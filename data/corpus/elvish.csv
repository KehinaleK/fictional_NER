the fairest daughter of the People of Horses,
you are light like the Sun on sky;
you are crowned by long golden hair,
shining like the bright rays of light,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You fell in the love with him;
you want his love, young princess.
Arwen is in the heart of Elessar;
he is a man and a bold warrior;
you love him but he does not love you,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

The darkness has come; they depart
to fight in a war in far lands,
and you they left at home:
they want you to watch women, children
in the fortresses in the high mountains,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

You want to find an end to your grief;
under the name of Dernhelm now you go
secretly like a [lit. the] normal horseman;
in the gray eyes a halfling saw
someone without hope who wants to die
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Under his dead horse lies the king
who was like a father to you and to your brother;
having a sword in your hands you are looking at
a terrible monster carrying fear;
a living man will not stop the Lord of corpses,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Éowyn, you are not a man, you are a woman;
he is strong, evil, dark and large,
rules over fear and Sauron over him;
you lifted a sword high,
his crown fell, he is fallen,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You wanted to die and have glory;
you fought the Lord of the Úlairi,
and he is dead but now you lie
beside your king, you do not see him;
you do not hear his last words,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You are sick and sorrowful by life;
an old woman speaks old wisdom:
the hands of the king heal.
Éowyn, they bore for you only life,
but not joy and desire to exist,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

The love of a minister you found;
he walked and talked together with you
between trees and flowers in his home;
he said to you that he loves you;
now you are healed by love
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Now you will not rule as [or, like] the queen;
you will be a healer like him;
not a shieldmaiden and not a princess,
you will love everything alive and fair;
as he will love you, you will love him

I walk in a cold winter's day,
under shadowy-grey skies,
the sun hidden by clouds.

I hear the cold Northwind
blowing through the leafless trees,
whispering in the twisted branches,
sounding like a Death-lament. 

The clamour of the Northwind fades,
and from the West I smell a
fragrant Zephyr blowing towards me,
and the lament changes to song. 

I see a swallow flying
from the South, the hot wind
under its sickle-shaped wings
singing towards the leafless trees. 

The clouds pass, and I see
the Sun setting in the West,
and from the East the Moon rises,
and in the twilight the star shines. 

And by the song of the nightingale
I return to whence I came,
under the starlit heavens,

",Genesis (Chapitre 1),"In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. 

The Earth was [*né] void and empty, and there was darkness upon [or, over] the abyss, but the Spirit of God hovered above the waters.

And God said, ""There be light!"" and there was light. 

God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it became evening, and it became morning, the first day. 

And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and it shall separate water from water."" 

And God made the firmament and separated the waters above the firmament from the waters below the firmament. And it was so. 

And God called the firmament Heaven. And it became evening, and it became morning, the second day.

And God said: ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered in one place, and let the dry land appear!"" and it was so.  

And God called the dry land Earth, but the waters [that were] gathered he called Sea. And God saw that it was good. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bear [forth] grass, plants making seeds, fruit-trees bearing [forth] fruit according to their kinds, in the earth."" and it was [became? remained?] so. 

The earth bore grass, plants making seeds, according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which their seeds are, according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And it became evening, and it became morning, the third day.  

And God said: ""Let there be lights [or, lamps] on the firmament of the heavens to separate day from night, and they will be signs of times and days and years. 

They will be lights on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth."" and it was [became?] so. 

God made the two great lights, the greatest light to rule at day and the lesser [pitya, ""small""] light to rule at night, and the stars.

And God placed them on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth.  

and to rule by day and by night and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fourth day. 

And God said: ""Let there be a swarm [úvë = ""abundance""] of living creatures in the waters, and let birds fly in the firmament of the heavens."" 

And God created the great animals of the sea and the whole abundance of living creatures that move in the waters, after their kinds, and all winged creatures after their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God blessed them and said, ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the water of the oceans, and the birds shall be many in the earth [lit. ""be the birds numerous on earth]!""  

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fifth day. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bring forth [lit. bear] living creatures according to their kinds, beasts and insects and the wild animals of the earth, according to their kinds."" 

And God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds, and the beasts according to their kinds and all animals that walk the earth [cemendë, locative], according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God said: ""Let us make Man in our image, shaped like us; and he shall rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts and all the earth and all animals that walk the earth."" 

And God created Man in his image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 

And God blessed them, and God said to them: ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the earth and subdue it [place it under you], and rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and all living creatures that walk the earth.""

And God said: ""Behold! I give you all plants making seeds, all there are on the entire surface of the earth, and all trees making fruits in which there are seeds. It is what you will eat. 

And to all wild animals and all the birds of heaven and to everything that walks the earth, to all that lives, I give all green plants to eat.""

",Genesis (Chapitre 2),"Thus heaven and earth and all of their army were completed [lit. finished].

And on the seventh day God concluded his work that he [had] made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he [had] made.  

And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, for on it God rested from all his work that he (had) created and made.

This is the story of heaven and earth when they were created, on the day that Jehovah God made heaven and earth. 

There was not yet any bush on the field on earth, and plants still did not grow, for Jehovah God [had] not made rain fall upon earth, and there was no man to cultivate [lit. work on] the field.

But a mist rose from the earth, and it gave water to the entire surface of the earth. 

And Jehovah God made the man out of dust from the earth and breathed [/blew] life-breath into his nose, and the man was [/became] a living creature. 

And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, toward the East, and there he placed the Man that he [had] made.

And Jehovah God made grow from the earth every tree that is beautiful to look upon [cenien, ""for seeing"", dative] and good to eat from [lit. ""good for eating from it""], and also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil.  

There was a river that went out from Eden to give water to the garden, and from there it was parted into four streams. 

The name of the first [river] is Pishon [Hebrew: Pîshôn]; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Havíla [Chawîlâ], where there is gold. 

And the gold of that land is good. There are also fragrant gum and onyx stone. 

And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Cush. 

And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is the one that goes east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

And Jehovah God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it [lit. work in it] and watch [over] it

But from the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil do not eat, for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die. 

And Jehovah God said: ""It is not good that the man is lonely. I will make him a helper that is like him."" 

Jehovah God made out of earth all the animals of the field and all the birds of heaven, and he lead them to the man to see what he called [/would call] them. What [lit. (that) which] the man called any living creature, it was (to be) its name. 

And the man named all the beasts and the birds of heaven and all wild animals, but for Man he did not find a helper that was like him.

Then Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and filled [up] with flesh.

And Jehovah God made the rib that he took from the man into a woman, and he lead her to the man. 

Then the man said: ""This time it is bones of my bones and flesh of my flesh! This one will be called Woman, for from Man she was taken."" 

Therefore [lit. thus] a man will leave [lit. pass from] his father and his mother and stick to his wife, and they will be(come) one flesh.

",Quenta Silmarillion Fragment: 'Of the beginning of days',"In the beginning of the days 

It is said within the wise ones that the firts of the wars began before the creation of Arda was achieved, before nothing had walked or grown on the surface of the Earth, and long Melkor was victorious.

But in the middle of this war, a courageous and powerful spirit came like a support to the Valar, from the end of the sky knowing the battle in the Little Earth, and Arda resounded by the echoes of his laugh.

Thus came Tulkas the Strong, his rage is like rage of the sky preceeded by dark clouds.
Melkor gone away from his joyful fury and abandonned Arda, and peace long lasted.

Tulkas abode on the Earth and was like the Valar of Arda, and Melkor stood in the outer Darkness.

His hatred of Tulkas was everlasting.
In this time, the Valar shaped the seas and the lands and the mountains, then Yavanna sowed the seeds she had create a long time ago.

Then, for the fires were controled or abandonned under the firts hills, the light was lacking.


By the request of Yavanna, Aule carried in the middle of the seas two large lamps he had made, for them to ligh the Middle Earth.


Varda filled them, Manwe lighted them and the Valar fixed them upon large pillars, higher than all the montagne that remained for us.

The first was raised in the North of Middle earth, its name was Illuin, the second in the south, Ormal, and the light of the Valar's lamps covered down the earth where everything shined like a day with no end.

'Then, the seeds sowed by Yavanna springed and sprouted swiftly, a crowd of things great and little raised on the earth, herbs and mosses and tall ferns, and tress crowned by clouds like living mountains which roots dived in the green twilight.'


'Animals came and dwelled in the valleys, in the rivers and in the lakes, and gone through the shade of the forests.'

'No flower had sprouted yet, no bird had sung, for these things waited for their hour in the heart of Yavanna, but she had though of abundance, and nowhere more rich (than) in the middle of the Earth, where the rays of the two lamps met and jointed.'

'In the great lake, on the isle of Almaren, in the time everything was new, in the time the new greenness was like an enchantment to the eyes of its creators, the Valar made their first dwelling, and longtime were fully happy about that.'

'It happened in this time that the Valar rested from their labours and looked at the growth and the expansion of the things they had though then created, Manwe established a great fest to which the Valar and their host came by his call.

'But Aule and Tulkas were lessened, for they served everybody by the skills of the first and the strenght of the second, pauseless and restless.


'And Melkor knew everything made, having secretly friends and spies within the Maiar which had fallen under his law.'

'Far away in the Darkness, he was hateful, greedy toward the works of his brothers which he had wanted under his authority.'

'Then out of the outermost limits of Ea he gethered the spirits kept for his service and he though he was strong.'


'Thinking his hour come, he approached toward Arda, he looked at it by his eyes and the vision of the Earth in its spring filled him with a new hatred.'

She took the silver dews from the vats of Telperion, and therewith she made new stars and brighter against the coming of the Firstborn; wherefore she whose name out of the deeps of time and the labours of Ea was Tintallë, the Kindler, was called after by the Elves Elentári, Queen of the Stars.

 ",Quenta Silmarillion Fragment: 'Of the ruin of Beleriand',"Battle Between Fingolfin and Morgoth

Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed-him to) the full downfall [of] the Noldor, and the downfall beyond repair [of] all houses-their; and from wrath and despair Rochallor-upon great horse-his got-he and departed alone and none were able to stop-him.  Passed-he over [the] Anfauglith like [a] wind in the dust, and all that beheld issuing-his departed thinking Oromë himself was come; for great rage was him-upon so eyes-his shone like the eyes the Valar-of.  And so came-he to Angband’s gates and sounded-he horn-his, and beat again upon the doorway and dared Morgoth to single war.  And Morgoth came.

That was the last time in those wars that passed-he the doorway [of] stronghold-his, and it is said that he answered not the dare [of] free will; but yet might-his was greatest [of] all things in this world alone [of] the Valar fear-he knew.  But-he could not deny the dare in front [of] commanders-his; for the stones rang from the high-music [of] Fingolfin’s horn, and voice-his came keen and clean down to the deeps [of] Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven and lord [of] slaves.  And so Morgoth came, ascending slowly from-his underground throneand the sound [of] feet-his was like [the] noise of a storm underground. And forth-issued-he clad in black armour; and stood before [the] King like [a] tower, iron-crowned, and might shield-his, token not carven, cast a shadow over him like [a] dark cloud.  But Fingolfin gleamed

Then Morgoth raised Grond [the] Hammer [of] Hell, and thrust it down like lightning.  But Fingolfin sprang away, and Grond rent [a] mighty pit in the earth, wherein mist and fire danced.  Many times Morgoth essayed to beat-him and each time Fingolfin leaped away, like lightning from under [a] dark cloud; and wounded-he Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave [a] shout [of] agony whereat the hosts of Angband fell on their faces in fear; and the shouts in the Northlands.

But then the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down shield-his-upon-him.  Three times crumbled down he was, and three times rose again and bore up broken shield-his and cloven helmet.  But the earth was all rent and pitted all round him, and fell-he backward-before the feet [of] Morgoth; and Morgoth set-his left foor on neck-his, and the burden [of] it was like [a] small hill.  And yet with final and hopeless stroke-his Fingolfin hewed, the foot with Ringil, and the blood forth-flooded black and smoking and filled the pits [of] Grond.

Like this died Fingolfin, High King [of the] Noldor, most brave and valiant [of the] Elven-kings [of] old.  The orcs made no festival [of] the war before the gate; and the Eldar sing not [of] it for sadness-theirs extends deep.

Account of the Valar and Maiar according to the lore of the Eldar. 
In the beginning Eru, the One, who in the Elvish tongue is named Ilúvatar, made the Ainur of his thought: and they made a great Music before him. In this Music the World was begun; for Ilúvatar made visible the song of the Ainur, and they beheld it as light in the darkness. And many among them became enamoured of its beauty, and of its history which they saw beginning and unfolding as in a vision. Therefore Ilúvatar gave to their vision Being, and set it amid the Void, and the Secret Fire was sent to burn at the heart of the World; and it was called Eä. Then those of the Ainur who desired it arose and entered into the World, at the beginning of Time; and it was their task to achieve it, and by their labours to fulfil the vision which they had seen. Long they laboured in the regions of Eä, which are vast beyond the thought of Elves and Men, until in the time appointed was made Arda, the Kingdom of Earth. Then they put on the raiment of Earth and descended into it, and dwelt therein ",Translated by Ryszard Derdzinski,1

",THE LAY OF LEITHIAN,"I. Of Thingol In Doriath
A king there was in days of old:
ere Men yet walked upon the mould
his power was reared in caverns' shade,
his hand was over glen and glade.
Of leaves his crown, his mantle green,
his silver lances long and keen;
the starlight in his shield was caught,
ere moon was made or sun was wrought.
In after-days, when to the shore
of Middle-earth from Valinor
the Elven-hosts in might returned,
and banners flew and beacons burned,
when kings of Eldamar went by
in strength of war, beneath the sky
then still his silver trumpets blew
when sun was young and moon was new.
Afar then in Beleriand,
in Doriath's beleaguered land,
King Thingol sat on guarded throne
in many-pillared halls of stone:
there beryl, pearl, and opal pale,
and metal wrought like fishes' mail,
buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
and gleaming spears were laid in hoard:
all these he had and counted small,
for clearer than all wealth in hall,
and fairer than are born to. Men,
a daughter had he, Lúthien. 

Of Lúthien the Beloved 

Such lissom limbs no more shall run
on the green earth beneath the sun;
so fair a maid no more shall be
from dawn to dusk, from sun to sea.
Her robe was blue as summer skies,
but grey as evening were her eyes;
her mantle sewn with lilies fair,
but dark as shadow was her hair.
Her feet were swift as bird on wing,
her laughter merry as the spring;
the slender willow the bowing reed,
the fragrance of a flowering mead,
the light upon the leaves of trees,
the voice of water, more than these
her beauty was and blissfulness,
her glory and her loveliness. ",Translated by Diego Sebastian Bao and Tandra Chu,1

Warmth has passed from the world. Stop, my legs! No more today.
The dust swirls above my head, my sinews shake a bit,
both rest then. The Sun crumbles, and floats tired beyond the mountains.
Stars icily glitter in the sky with their cruel light.
A sad vision of my self long years ago (or was it ages?)
trembles in the air among the trees. I shut my eyes.
It is enough to see the end of the journey all the time. It dangles
in the rear of my mind every day. Rest,
my mind, rest! Nothing remains but resolve.
They say, the Elves praise the stars. I myself dread
their endless glare, for my will collapses
under that cold perfection. The words, my message
to utter have abandoned me when the first faint glitter
of fear fell on my head. The dire message,
to tell the Valar that life is defeated, all
the Elves are gone, the Dwarves lie dead
deep under rocks too heavy to heave,
and countless Morgoths have arisen. Perhaps
it is proper that my tongue is knotted
for when I say the words, the roots of the world
will surely crumble crying, and the Void covers all.

But alas! still
the ship waits there in that harbour far away, that
I will never find. Or so it seems.

And David begat Solomon by the wife of Uriah, and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa, and Asa begat Joshaphat, and Joshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah, and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah, and Hezeciah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah, and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time that the people was led away as exiles to Babylon.

After the deportation to Babel Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel, and Zerubbabel begad Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor, and Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud, and Eliud begat Eleazar, ar Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary [María], by whom Jesus, who is called Christ, was born.

Thus all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen, and from David to the deportation to Babel there are fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babel to Christ fourteen generations.

But Jesus Christ was born in this manner: When his mother Mary was obliged to marry Joseph, she was found with child by Holy Spirit, before they came together. But Joseph her husband, who was just and did not wish to humiliate her, wanted to release her secretly. But after he thought this, behold! the Lord's angel came to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid of taking Mary your wife to your house, for [that] which has been conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you will name that one Jesus, for that one will deliver his people from their sins.” All these things happened in order to make true [that] which the Lord said by his herald, saying: “Behold! the maiden will be with child and will bear a son, and they will give that one the name Immanuel” – which means “With us is God.” Then Joseph, after his awakening from his sleep, did as the Lord's angel had commanded him, and he took his wife to his house.

For in the East we saw his star, and we have come to bow before him.” 3 When he heard this, King Herod was stirred up, and all of Jerusalem with him, 4 and gathering all the chief priests and the scribes among the people, he asked them about where the Christ was to be born. 5 They said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so [it] is written by the prophet: 'And you, Bethlehem of Judea, is by no means the smallest among the governors of Judea; for from you shall come a ruler, who will be a shepherd for my people Israel.”

7 Then Herod secretly summoned the star-gazers and asked them about the first time that they saw the star. 8 He sent them to Bethlehem saying: “Go, seek the child, and when you have found him, tell me, for me to be able to go to bow before him, I as well.” 9 When they heard the king they went away, and look! the star that they had seen in the East went before them, until it stopped above the place where the child was. 10 Seeing the star gave them great joy. 11 They went inside the house and saw the child with Mary its mother, and falling down they bowed to him. They opened their treasures and gave to him gifts: gold and frankincense and fragrant resin.

12 But when they were told [lit. when it was told to them] in a dream about the danger of returning to Herod, they went to their land by another road.

13After they went away, look! an angel of the Lord showed himself to Joseph in a dream, saying: “Rise, take the child and its mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I shall tell you; for Herod will seek the child to kill it.” 14 And he arose and took the child and its mother with him at night, and he went away to Egypt, 15 and he remained there until Herod's death. Thus was made true what was said by the Lord through [-nen] his prophet [tercáno, herald], saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”

16 Then Herod, seeing that he was made a fool by the star-gazers, was filled with great rage, and he sent soldiers [ohtar-li > ohtalli] to kill all boys in Bethlehem and in all regions surrounding it, from two years and under that, according to the time of which he received knowledge from the star-gazers. 17 Then was made true [that] which was spoken through Jeremiah the Prophet, saying: 18 “A voice was heard in Rama, wailing and great lament – Rachel wailing for her children, and she did not want comfort, for they are gone.”

19 After Herod's death, behold! an angel of the Lord showed himself to Joseph in a dream in Egypt, 20 and he said: “Rise, take the child and go into the land of Israel, for those who want to take the child's life are dead.” 21 He arose and took the child and its mother and went into the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that Arcelaus ruled in Judea in the place of Herod his father, he feared to go there. In a dream he was told about his danger, and he went away into the region of Galilee. 23 He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, to make true [that] which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

John was wrapped in a cloak of hairs of camels and had a leather-belt around his hips, and his food was grasshoppers and wild honey. 5 Then Jerusalem and all of Judea and the entire land surrounding Jordan went out to him, 6 and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

7 When he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees come to the baptism, he said to them: “Offspring of serpents, who taught you to escape from the coming wrath? 8 Then bear fruit worthy of the repentance! 9 And do not think that you may say to yourselves: 'Our father is Abraham' – for I say to you that God can rise up children to Abraham from these stones. 10 Even now the ax is lying by the roots of the trees: Thus every three that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 11 I baptize you with water, into repentance. But [the one] that comes after me is mightier than I – I am not worthy to take the shoes from his feet. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and with fire. 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his grain into the store, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that nobody can extinguish.

13 Then Jesus went from Galilee to Jordan and came to John to be baptized by him. 14 But John denied him, and he said: “My need is that I will be baptized by you, and you are coming to me!”15 But in answer Jesus said: “Allow it to happen, for thus it is proper for us [dual] to do everything that is just.” Then he allowed him [to come]. 16 After Jesus was baptized he came straightway out of the water, and behold! heaven was opened to him, and he saw God's Spirit coming down upon him like a dove. 17 Behold!

5 Then the Devil led him to the holy city and put him at the pinnacle of the temple. He said to him: “If you are God's son, throw yourself down, for [it] is written: He will command his angels concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, to stop your foot from striking against [any] stone.” 7 Jesus said: “Again [it] is written: Do not test the Lord your God!”

8 Again the Devil brought him to an extremely high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of earth and their glory. 9 And he said to him: “All these things I will give to you if you fall down and you worship me.” 10 Then Jesus said to him: “Begone, Satan! For [it] is written: The Lord your God you are to worship, and he alone you are to serve.” 11 Then the Devil went away from him, and behold! angels came and served him.

12 After hearing that John was put in prison, he went off into Galilee. 13 He went away from Nazareth and came and dwelt in Capernaum beside [the] sea, in Zebulon's and Naphtali's regions, 14 to make true [that] which was said through Isaiah the Prophet when he said: 15 “O land of Zebulon and Naphtali, the sea-road beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations! 16 The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to [those] who sat in the region of death-shadow, light arose.” 17 From that time he made his message known and said: “Find repentance, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!”

18 Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, throwing a net into the sea, for they [dual] were fishers. 19 And he said to them: “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” 20 In the same moment they left their net and followed him. 21 Going from there he saw also two others who were brothers, James [/Jacob] son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their [dual] father, repairing their nets – and he called them. 22 In the same moment they abandoned the boat and their father, and followed him.

23 And he went through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and making known the gospel about the kingdom and healing every illness and every sickness among the people. 24 And the story about him went into all of Syria, and they brought to him all ill ones, tormented by illnesses and by torments of many kinds: demon-possessed ones and moon-sick ones and impeded ones – and he healed them. 25 And great crowds followed him, from Galile and the Ten Cities and Jerusalem and Judea, and from the country beyond the Jordan.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

Na, tá, ilvane, tambe Atarelda menelde ilvana ná.",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 5,"Seeing the crowds he went up into the mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him. 2 And he opened his mouth and instructed them, saying:

3 “Happy are the lacking ones in spirit, for they will possess the kingdom of heaven!

4 Happy are the ones that have grief, for they shall be comforted!

5 Happy are the gentle ones, for they shall be heirs of earth!

6 Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!

7 Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!

8 Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!

9 Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!

10 Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!

11 Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me. You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.

3 You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not [any]more good for a single thing, but is being thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.

14 You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide. 15 One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house. 16 Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.

17 Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real! 18 For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass [away] before a single smallest letter or a single mark [tehta: diacritic] will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true. 19 Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.

21 You heard that [it] was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement! 22 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with [or “against”, -nna] his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' [= Semitic word of contempt] will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!

23 If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a strife with you, 24 you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.

25 Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant [námondur: judge-servant], and you will be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!

27 You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.

29 If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna. 30 And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.

31 It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce. But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.

33 Furthermore, you have heard that [it] was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given. 34 But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven [menel-nen > menelden], for it is the throne of God, 35 or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.

36 Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37  Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! [That] which is beyond this, is of evil.

38 You have heard that [it] has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! 39 But I say to you: Do not stand against [he] that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him. 40 If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak. 41 And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to [the one] who asks of you, and do not turn [Q: turn yourself] from [anyone] who wants to use something that you have.

43 You have heard that [it] is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy! 44 But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you, 45 for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.

46 If you love [those] who love you, what is your reward? Do not the tax collectors do the same thing?

47 And if you greet only your brothers, how is this a great thing? Do not people of the nations do the same?

48 Be, then, perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

Truly I say to you: They are receiving their whole reward. 3 But you, when you give gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. 4 Thus your gifts of mercy will be in secret; then your father, who is watching in secret, will reward you.

5 Therefore, when you [pl.] pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray when they are standing on the corners of the roads, in order to be visible to men. 6 Truly I tell you: They are receiving their entire reward. 7 But you [sg.], when you pray, go into your own chamber, and after closing your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who is secretly watching, will pay you. 7 But when you are praying, do not say the same things in monotonous repetition, as people of the [heathen] nations do, for they think that they will be being heard by using numerous words. 8 Therefore, do not be like them, for God your [pl.] Father know your needs before you request [anything] from him.

9 Pray, then, thus: Our Father in heaven, holy be your name! 10 Let your kingdom come! Let your will be done on earth as in heaven! 11 Give us today our daily bread, 12 and forgive us our sins as we forgive them to them that sin against us. 13 Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil! Amen!

14 If you forgive men their crimes, your Father in heaven will also forgive you; 15 but if you do not forgive men, your Father will in the same manner not forgive your crimes to you.

16 When you [pl.] keep a fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who make their face disfigured in order to make their fast visible to men. Truly I say to you: They are receiving their entire reward. 17 But you [sg.], when you keep a fast, put oil on your head and wash your face. 18 Thus your fasting will not be visible to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who secretly is watching, will pay [/reward] you.

19 Do not gather for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and erosion devour, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But gather for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and erosion do not devour, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

22 Your body's lamp is the eye. Therefore, if your eye is in health, your entire body will be bright, 23 but if your eye is wicked, your entire body will be dark. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great the darkness is!

24 It is not possible for anyone to be slave for two lords; he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and loathe the other. You cannot be slaves for God and for Mammon alike.

25 Therefore I say to you: Do not be troubled about yourselves, about what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies, concerning the clothers you will wear.  Is the life not more than food and the body than the clothes? 26 Notice the birds of heaven, that they do not sow or reap or gather into barns [haurar, stores], and yet your heavenly Father gives them food. Are you not more important than them? 27 Who among you can add a single cubit to his life? 28 Furthermore, concerning clothes, what is your reason for being troubled? Learn from [or 'by', -nen] the lilies of the field, how they do not labour and do not twine [threads], 29 but I tell you that Solomon in his glory was not clad as a single [one] among them. 30 If God so adorns the plants in the field, that exist today and will be gone tomorrow, how much more richly will he cover you, you of little faith? 31 Therefore, do not be troubled and say: “What will we eat?” or “With what are we to cover ourselves?” 32 For all these things the nations pursue. But your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.

33 Seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. 34 Therefore, do not be troubled about the following day, for the following day will have its own troubles. Every day's evil suffices for it.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

First pull he rafter out from your own eye, and then you can see how to pull the sedge out of your brother's eye.

6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs; in the same manner, do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet and will turn themselves [around] and tear you [up].

7 Ask, and [it] will be given you; seek, and you shall find, knock, and [it] will be opened to you. 8 For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking [it] will be opened. 19 Who among you, if his son asks for a bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish – surely he will not give him a snake? 11 Therefore, if you that are wicked know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those that ask of him?

12 Therefore, all things that you want done to you by men, do them in the same manner. That is what the Law and the Prophets mean.

13 Enter through the narrow gate, for broad and wide is the road that leads away to destruction, and numerous are the ones that enter through it, 14 but narrow [náha] is the gate and narrow [or 'thin', lenwa] is the road leading into life, and few are [the ones] that find it.

15 Watch yourselves concerning the false prophets that come to you in sheep's clothing, but on the inside they are devouring wolves. 16 By their fruits you will know them. People do not gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, right? 17 Thus every good tree bears good fruit, but every rotten tree produces foul fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit; in the same manner, a rotten tree cannot bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Indeed by their fruit you will know them!

21 Not everyone who says to me: Lord, Lord, will come into the kingdom of heaven, but [the one] who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Numerous ones will say to me in that day:  'Lord, Lord, did we not speak as prophets in your name, and throw out demons in your name, and do many mighty deeds in your name?' 23 But then I will tell them: 'I did not ever know you! Get away from me, you who break the law!'

24 Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine will be like an intelligent man, who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain poured down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.

26 Furthermore, everyone that hears these words of mine and does not do according to them is like an unintelligent man, who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain poured down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great!”

Hearing that, Jesus marvelled and said to [the ones] that followed him: “I truly say to you, such faith I have not found in anyone in Israel. 11 But I say to you that numerous ones will come from East and West and will lie at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 12 while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness on the outside. There will be their waiting and their grinding of teeth! 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion: “Go! As you have believed, so let it happen for you!” And the servant was healed in that hour.

14 And Jesus, when he came into Peter's house, saw his wife's mother bedridden and sick with a fever. 15 And Jesus touched her hand, and the fever vanished from her. And she arose and ministered to him.

16 But after evening came, people brought to him many that were possessed by demons, and he threw out the demons with a word, and he healed all that were suffering, 17 to make true what was written through Isaiah the Prophet saying: “He took our illnesses and bore our sicknesses!”

18 When Jesus saw a throng that surrounded him, he commanded that they were to go [Q: will go] to the other shore. 19 And a scribe came to him and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you to every place that you go!” 20 But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of Man does not have a place where he may put his head!” 21 Then another among his disciples sayd to him: “Lord, let me first go away and bring my father to his grave!” 22 Jesus said to him: “Follow me, and let the dead bring their dead ones to their graves!”

23 And when he went into a boat, his disciples followed him. 24 And look, there was an uprising in the sea, covering the boat with the waves, but he was asleep. 25 And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are dying!” 26 But he said to them: “How is [it] that you are timid, people of little faith?” Then, standing up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a deep silence. 27 But the men were filled with wonder and said: “Of what kind is this man, since also the winds and the sea do as he says?”

28 When he came to the other shore, into the land of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by demons met him, coming from the graves, extremely fierce. Therefore there was not anyone with the courage to choose that road. 29 And behold! they cried [out], saying: “What is to us [dual] and to you, Son of God? Have you come hither to torment us [dual] before the time?” 30 But far from them was a herd of many pigs on pasture. 31 The demons asked of him, saying: “If you throw us out, send us into the herd of pigs!” 32 And he said to them: “Go!” And after coming out they went into the pigs, and behold! the entire herd wend rushing over the precipice into the sea, and they died in the waters. 33 But the shepherds [or, herders] fled, and going into the city they told everything, also concerning the demon-possessed ones. 34 And behold! the entire city went out to meet Jesus, and after seeing him they urged him to go away from their regions.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

Seeing their faith Jesus said to the lame one: “Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven!” 2 And behold, some among the scribes said to themselves: “This man is blaspheming!” 4 And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: “How is [it] that you are thinking wicked things in your heart? 5 For what is the more easy thing to say: Your sins are forgiven, or: Rise and walk – ? But for you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins – ” then he said to the lame one: “Rise, take your bed and go to your home!” 7 And he arose and went to his home. 8 Seeing that, the crowds were terrified and gave glory to God, who had given such power to men.

9 And going away from there Jesus saw a man sit at the tax office, called Matthew, and he said to him: “Follow me!” And that one arose and followed him. 10 Thereafter, while he lay by the table in the house, behold! many tax collectors and sinners came and lay there with Jesus and his disciples. 11 But seeing that, the Pharisees were saying to his disciples: “How is [it] that your teacher eats with the tax collectors and sinners? 12 Hearing it, he said: “People in health do not have [any] need of a healer, but the ailing ones [do]. 13 Go and learn what this means: I want mercy and not sacrifice. For I came to call, not righteous ones, but sinners!”

14 Then John the Baptist's disciples came to him and asked: “How is [it] that we and the Pharisees keep fasts, but your disciples do not keep fasts?” 15 And Jesus said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom surely cannot have grief while the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will keep fasts. 16 [There] is not anyone who fastens a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for its full power will pull from it, and there will be a worse tearing. 17 Furthermore, [there] is not anyone who puts new wine in old skin-bottles, but if one does do so, the skin-bottles are ruptured and the wine pours out and the skin-bottles are destroyed. But people put new wine in new skin-bottles, and both remain!”

18 While he told them these things, behold! a ruler came near and bowed to him, saying: “My daughter died a little while ago, but come and put your hand on her, and she will return to life!”

19 Then Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples. 20 And behold! a woman having a flood of blood for [ter, through] twelve years came behind him and touched the rim of his cloak, 21 for she said to herself: “If only I touch his cloak I shall be saved!” 22 Jesus turned and, noticing her, said: “Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you!” And from that time the woman had health.

23 When he came to the house of the ruler and saw the flute-players and the crowd making clamour, 24 Jesus said: “Go away from here, for the maiden did not die, but she is asleep. Then they laughed at him with scorn. 25 After he sent the crowd outside he entered and took her hand, and the maiden arose. 26 And this story went out to that entire region.

27 When Jesus passed along from there, two blind men followed him, crying and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”  28 After he entered the house, the sightless ones came to him, and Jesus said to them: “Do you believe that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord!” 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying: “May it happen to you as you believe!” 30 And their eyes were opened. Furthermore, Jesus firmly commanded them, saying: “See that you do not let anyone know it!” 31 But they, when they went outside, told about him to in that entire region.

32 Now, when he went away, behold! people brought him a dumb man possessed by a demon, 33 and after the demon was thrown out, the dumb man spoke. The crowds marvelled and said: “A thing like this has not ever been seen in Israel!” 34 But the Pharisees said: “By the lord of the demons he throws out the demons!”

35 And Jesus went in a circuit to all the cities and villages, instructing in their synagogues and making known the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and every kind of ailment. 36 When he saw the crowds, his heart went out to them, for they were naked and scattered like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is great, but [those] who work are few.

2 [The] names of the twelve disciples are these: First Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, 3 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, Jacob the brother of Alpheus and Thaddeus, 4 Simon the Cananean and Judas Iscariot, who after gave him over.

5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these commands: “Do not go on the road to the [gentile] nations, and do not come into a Samaritan city. 6 Instead [i mende 'in the place'], go to the lost sheep from the house of Israel! 7 While you go, make known the message, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal sick ones, raise dead ones, cleanse skin-diseased ones, throw out demons! You have received [it] for nothing, give [it] for nothing! 9 Do not put gold or silver or copper in your belt 10 or bring a food-pouch for the journey, or two tunics, or shoes or a staff, for [the one] who works is worthy of his food.

In every city or village into which you come, find out who in it is worthy, and remain there until you go away. 12 When you come into the house, greet it, 13 and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you. 14 Whenever anyone does not receive you or listens to your words, when you go away form that house or from that city, shake the dust from your feet [dual]. 15 Truly I say to you: The Day of Judgement will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for that city!

16 Behold! I send you like sheep among wolves. Therefore be intelligent like serpents and guiltless like doves. 17 Watch yourselves against men, for they will give you over to tribunals and will flay you in their synagogues. 18 You will be led before governors and kings concernin me, as a witness to them and to the nations. 19 But when they give you over, do not be troubled about how or what you are to say, for [that] which you are to say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For [the ones] that speak are not only you, but your Father's Spirit that speaks by you. 21 Furthermore, brother will give brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against their parents [dual] and will cause their [dual] death. 22 And you will be hated by all concerning my name, but who endures to the end, he will he saved. 23 When they pursue you in this city, flee to another, for truly I say to you: By no means will you complete the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man shall come.

24 A disciple is not above [the one] who instructs him, or a slave above his lord. 25 It suffices for the disciple if he becomes like [the one] who instructs him, and the slave like his lord. If people called the householder Beelzebul, how much more will they call the people of his house so?

26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. 27 [That] which I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and [that] which you hear being whispered, make it known from the tops of the houses. 28 And not do fear [those] those that kills the body but cannot kill the soul; sooner [or, rather] fear [the one] that can undo soul and body alike in Gehenna. 29 But are not two sparrows sold for a piece of copper? And yet one among them [dual] does not fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But also [or, even] all the hairs on your head are counted. 31 Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.

32 Therefore everyone that confesses me before men, I as well will confess before my father who is in heaven; 33 but anyone that denies me before men, I as well will deny before my Father who is in heaven. 34 Do not think that I have come to put peace on earth; I have not come to put peace [here], but a sword. 35 For I came to cause splits: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against the mother of her husband; 36 and a man's enemies are the people of his house. 37 If a person's father or mother is dearer to him than I [am], he is not worthy of me; and if a person's son or daughter is dearer to him than me, he is not worthy of me. 38 And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me. 39 [The] one that finds his life, to him it shall be lost, but the person whose life becomes lost for my sake [lit. for my good], will find it.

40 [He] that receives you receives also me, and [he] that receives me receives also the one who sent me. 41 [The one] that receives a prophet since he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and [the one] that receives a just man since he is just, will receive a just man's reward. 42 And anyone that gives to a person among these small ones only a cup of cold water since he is a disciple – truly I say to you, his reward will by no means be lost to him.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

7 When they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd concerning John: “What did you go forth into the desert to see? A sedge moving by the wind? 9 No, what did you go forth to see? A man having soft clothes? Behold, those that have soft clothes are in the houses of kings! 9 But for what reason did you go forth? Seeing a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and far more than a prophet! 10 He is the person of whom [it] is written: “Behold, I send my herald in front of you, in order to prepare your way before you. 11 Truly I say to you: Among [those] that are born by women, [there] is not anyone greater than John the Baptist, but the smallest in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and those that do violence seize it. 13 For all the prophets and the Law spoke their prophecies until John, 14 and if you wish to receive it, he is Elijah that was going to come. 15 [He] who has ears, may he hear!

16 With what am I to compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the market places [mancanóme = trade-place], crying to the other children: 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we were wailing, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.' 18 For John came without eating or drinking, and people say: 'He is possessed by a demon!' 19 The Son of Men came eating and drinking, and people say: 'Look! A man given to gluttony and to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' And yet Wisdom has been made shown righteous by its deeds!”

20 Then he began to rebuke [naitya = put to shame] the cities where his most numerous of his mighty deeds happened, since they failed to find repentance: “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds that have happened in you [dual] happened in Tyre or Sidon, long ago they [would have] sought repentance in sackcloth [findilanne = hair-cloth] and ash! 22 Therefore I say to you: To Tyre and Sidon the Day of Judgement will be more bearable than it will be for you [dual]. [Literally: ... will be bearable before (that) which it will be for you.] 23 And you, Capernaum, will you be raised to heaven? Down to Mandos [Greek: Hades] you will come, for if the mighty deeds that happened in you [had] happened in Sodom, that city [would have] stood until this day. 24 Therefore I say to you: To the land of Sodom the day of Judgment will be more bearable than it will be for you!”

25 At that time Jesus rose his voice and said: “I praise you, Father, Lord over heaven and earth, since you have hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and has revealed them to babes! 26 Yes, Father, for doing so was what pleased you! 27 All things are given to me by my Father, and [there] is not anyone who wholly knows the Son except the Father; furthermore, [there] is not anyone who wholly knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him. 28 Come to me, all that toil and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest! 29 Put my yoke on yourselves and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is gentle, and my burden light.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

His disciples were hungry and started to pick heads or grain to eat. 2 And seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Behold! Your disiciples do what is not alloewd to do on the day of rest!” 3 He said to them: “Have you not read about what David did when he and the men with him were hungry. 4 He went into God's house and ate the breads of showing, which were not allowed food for him or for those that were with him, but for the priests alone? 5 Or have you not read in the Law that on the day of rest the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are without guilt? 6 But I say to you that here is [that] which is greater than the temple. 7 But if you understood what this word means: 'I want mercy, and not sacrifice', you did not judge [or, would not judge] those that are without guilt. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the day of rest!”

9 After he went away from there he came into their synagogue. 10 And behold! [there] was there a man having a withered hand. 11 He said to them: “Who is the man among you having a single sheep who does not, if this sheep falls into a hollow on the day of rest, take hold of it and lift it out? 13 But how much more precious than a sheep is a man! Thus [it] is allowed to do good on the day of rest!” 12 Then he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and it was renewed and was like the other hand. 14 But the Pharisees went outside and made plans about how they were going to destroy him.

15 Knowing that, Jesus went away from there. Numerous ones also followed him, and he healed all among them, 16 but he commanded them firmly that they were [Q: are] not to make him known, 17 to fulfill [lit. make true] which was said through Isaiah the Prophet, who said:

18 “Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved one, by whom my soul is pleased. I shall put my spirit in him, and justice [or, judgement] he will make known to the nations. 19 He shall not quarrel or cry, and no one will hear his voice on the roads. 20 A broken sedge he shall not crush, and a smouldering wick [urulanya = fire-thread] he shall not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory. 21 And in his name the nations shall put their hope!”

22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed person, blind and dumb, and he healed him, causing the dumb man to talk and see. 23 And all the crowd were beside themselves with wonder, and they said: “Maybe this man is the Son of David!” 24 Hearing that, the Pharisees said: “This man does not throw out the demons except by the lord of the demons, Beelzebub!” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself becomes void, and every city and house split against itself will not stand. 26 And if Satan throws out Satan, he is split against himself; then how will his kingdom stand? 27 Furthermore, if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if [it is] by God's spirit I throw out the demons, God's kingdom has indeed come to you. 29 Or how can anyone go into the house of a strong man and take his goods, if he does not firstly bind the strong man? And then he will steal the things in his house. 30 [The one] who is not with me is my enemy, ar [the one] who does not gather with me, scatters.

31 Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to Men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 For anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, to him it will be forgiven, but [as for the one] who speaks against the Holy spirit, that will not be forgiven him, in this age and the coming one alike.

33 Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.

34 Offspring of snakes, how can you say good things, you who are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good man brings good things from his good treasure, but the bad [olca, wicked] man brings wicked things from his bad treasure. 36 I say to you that concerning every saying that men say that is not beneficial, they will answer on the Day of Judgement, 37 for by your own words you will be judged [to be] righteous, and by your own words you will be judged evil!”

38 Then some among [the] Pharisees answered him: “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you!” 39 In answer he said to them: “A wicked and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet. 40 For like Jonah was in the inward part [mitya, interior] of the big fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 41 Men from Ninive will arise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil, for they found repentance when Jonah made known his message, but behold! here is what is greater than Jonah!

42 The queen of the South will rise in the judgment with this generation and will judge it evil, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold! here is what is greater than Solomon.

43 When an unclean spirit comes out from a man, it passes through dry places seeking a place of rest, but it does not find [any]. 44 Then it says: “I will return to my house from which I moved,” and coming to it, it finds the house empty, but clean and adorned. 45 Then it goes away and brings with itself seven other spirits, more wicked than itself, and having entered they dwell there, and that man's final state is worse than the first! So it will be also for this wicked generation!”

46 As he was still speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and his brothers stood on the outside and wished to speak with him. 47 And someone said to him: “Behold! Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to speak with you!” 48 In answer he said to [the one] who spoke to him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 49 And reaching out with his hand towards his disciples he said: “Behold my mother and my brothers! 50 Anyone who does the will of my father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother!”",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

Mal Yésus quente téna: “Erutercáno ua pene laitie hequa vehteryasse ar coaryasse!” Ar uas carne tasse rimbe taure cardali, pan pennelte savie.",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 13,"On that day Jesus, after he went from the house, was sitting beside the sea, 2 and great crowds gathered to him. Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 While he was sowing some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them. 5 Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil. 6 But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them. 8 But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty. 9 Who has ears, may he be hearing!

10 And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?” 11 In reply he said: “To you it has been given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given. 12 For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand, 14 and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see. 15 For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”

16 But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear. 17 And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see [the things] that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.

18 Therefore, you hear [imperative!] the comparison about the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is [that] which was sown by the road. 20 And [the one] that was sown upon the rock, that is [the one] who hears the word and receives it in joy. 21 And yet he does not have [any] root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment. 22 And [the one] that was sown among the thorns, this is [the one] who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and he is without fruit.

23 And [the one] who was sown on the good earth, this is [the one] who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.”

24 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away. 26 When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up. 27 Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?” 28 He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go [= do you wish us to go] to gather them?” 29 He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants. 30 Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”

31 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has become a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”

33 Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”

34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in comparisons, and without a comparison he did not speak to them, 35 to make true [that] which was said through the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth in comparisons; I will make known things hidden from the foundation!”

36 Then, after sending the crowds away, he went into the boat. And his disciples came to him and said: “Let us understand the comparison about the worthless plants in the field!” 37 In answer he said: “[The one] who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; 38 the field is the world, and the good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom, but the worthless plands are the sons of the Wicked One. 39 The enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age, the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore, as when the worthless plants are being gathered and burnt by fire, so it will be at the conclusion of the age: 42 The Son of Man will send his angles, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall and the people that break the law, 42 and they will thrown them into the oven of fire. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth. 43 Then the righteous ones will shine like the Sun, in their Father's kingdom. [The one] who has hears, let him be hearing!

44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and for [-nen] his joy he goes away and sells the things that he has, and trades to himself that field.

45 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a tradesman seeking good pearls: 46 After finding one pearl that was most precious, he went away and sold everything that he had and traded it to himself.

47 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net, thrown into the sea and gathering fishes of every kind. 48 When it was full, they pulled it up onto the beach and sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but the worthless ones they threw away. 49 Thus it will be at the conclusion of the age: The angels will go forth and will separate the wicked from the righteous, 50 and they will throw them into the fiery oven. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth.

51 Do you understand all these things?” They said to him: “Yes!” 52 Then he said to them: “Therefore every scribe, instructed about the kingdom of heaven, is like a man, a householder, who brings out from his treasure things new and old!”

53 And then, after Jesus completed these comparisons, he crossed land from there. 54 And when he came to his home territory, he instructed them in their synagogue. Thus they were filled with wonder and said: “From where did this man receive this wisdom and these mighty deeds? Is this not the carpenter's son? Is his mother not Mary, and his brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Juda? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man receive all these things?” 57 Therefore they were angry with [-nna, against] him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet does not lack honor except in his home territory and in his house!” 58 And he did not do numerous mighty deeds there, since they lacked faith.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1
