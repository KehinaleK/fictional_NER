the fairest daughter of the People of Horses,
you are light like the Sun on sky;
you are crowned by long golden hair,
shining like the bright rays of light,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You fell in the love with him;
you want his love, young princess.
Arwen is in the heart of Elessar;
he is a man and a bold warrior;
you love him but he does not love you,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

The darkness has come; they depart
to fight in a war in far lands,
and you they left at home:
they want you to watch women, children
in the fortresses in the high mountains,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

You want to find an end to your grief;
under the name of Dernhelm now you go
secretly like a [lit. the] normal horseman;
in the gray eyes a halfling saw
someone without hope who wants to die
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Under his dead horse lies the king
who was like a father to you and to your brother;
having a sword in your hands you are looking at
a terrible monster carrying fear;
a living man will not stop the Lord of corpses,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Éowyn, you are not a man, you are a woman;
he is strong, evil, dark and large,
rules over fear and Sauron over him;
you lifted a sword high,
his crown fell, he is fallen,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You wanted to die and have glory;
you fought the Lord of the Úlairi,
and he is dead but now you lie
beside your king, you do not see him;
you do not hear his last words,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

You are sick and sorrowful by life;
an old woman speaks old wisdom:
the hands of the king heal.
Éowyn, they bore for you only life,
but not joy and desire to exist,
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden.

The love of a minister you found;
he walked and talked together with you
between trees and flowers in his home;
he said to you that he loves you;
now you are healed by love
Éowyn princess shieldmaiden. 

Now you will not rule as [or, like] the queen;
you will be a healer like him;
not a shieldmaiden and not a princess,
you will love everything alive and fair;
as he will love you, you will love him
Éowyn bride healer. ",Ales Bican,1

",In a winter's day,"From my home to the street
I walk in a cold winter's day,
under shadowy-grey skies,
the sun hidden by clouds.

I hear the cold Northwind
blowing through the leafless trees,
whispering in the twisted branches,
sounding like a Death-lament. 

The clamour of the Northwind fades,
and from the West I smell a
fragrant Zephyr blowing towards me,
and the lament changes to song. 

I see a swallow flying
from the South, the hot wind
under its sickle-shaped wings
singing towards the leafless trees. 

The clouds pass, and I see
the Sun setting in the West,
and from the East the Moon rises,
and in the twilight the star shines. 

And by the song of the nightingale
I return to whence I came,
under the starlit heavens,
in this winter's evening. ",Vicente Velasco,1

",Genesis (Chapitre 1),"In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. 

The Earth was [*né] void and empty, and there was darkness upon [or, over] the abyss, but the Spirit of God hovered above the waters.

And God said, ""There be light!"" and there was light. 

God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it became evening, and it became morning, the first day. 

And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and it shall separate water from water."" 

And God made the firmament and separated the waters above the firmament from the waters below the firmament. And it was so. 

And God called the firmament Heaven. And it became evening, and it became morning, the second day.

And God said: ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered in one place, and let the dry land appear!"" and it was so.  

And God called the dry land Earth, but the waters [that were] gathered he called Sea. And God saw that it was good. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bear [forth] grass, plants making seeds, fruit-trees bearing [forth] fruit according to their kinds, in the earth."" and it was [became? remained?] so. 

The earth bore grass, plants making seeds, according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which their seeds are, according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And it became evening, and it became morning, the third day.  

And God said: ""Let there be lights [or, lamps] on the firmament of the heavens to separate day from night, and they will be signs of times and days and years. 

They will be lights on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth."" and it was [became?] so. 

God made the two great lights, the greatest light to rule at day and the lesser [pitya, ""small""] light to rule at night, and the stars.

And God placed them on the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth.  

and to rule by day and by night and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fourth day. 

And God said: ""Let there be a swarm [úvë = ""abundance""] of living creatures in the waters, and let birds fly in the firmament of the heavens."" 

And God created the great animals of the sea and the whole abundance of living creatures that move in the waters, after their kinds, and all winged creatures after their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God blessed them and said, ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the water of the oceans, and the birds shall be many in the earth [lit. ""be the birds numerous on earth]!""  

And it became evening, and it became morning, the fifth day. 

And God said: ""Let the earth bring forth [lit. bear] living creatures according to their kinds, beasts and insects and the wild animals of the earth, according to their kinds."" 

And God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds, and the beasts according to their kinds and all animals that walk the earth [cemendë, locative], according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

And God said: ""Let us make Man in our image, shaped like us; and he shall rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts and all the earth and all animals that walk the earth."" 

And God created Man in his image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 

And God blessed them, and God said to them: ""Be fruitful and be[come] many, fill the earth and subdue it [place it under you], and rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and all living creatures that walk the earth.""

And God said: ""Behold! I give you all plants making seeds, all there are on the entire surface of the earth, and all trees making fruits in which there are seeds. It is what you will eat. 

And to all wild animals and all the birds of heaven and to everything that walks the earth, to all that lives, I give all green plants to eat.""

And God saw all that he [had] made, and behold! it was very good. And it became evening, and it became morning, the sixth day.",,1

",Genesis (Chapitre 2),"Thus heaven and earth and all of their army were completed [lit. finished].

And on the seventh day God concluded his work that he [had] made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he [had] made.  

And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, for on it God rested from all his work that he (had) created and made.

This is the story of heaven and earth when they were created, on the day that Jehovah God made heaven and earth. 

There was not yet any bush on the field on earth, and plants still did not grow, for Jehovah God [had] not made rain fall upon earth, and there was no man to cultivate [lit. work on] the field.

But a mist rose from the earth, and it gave water to the entire surface of the earth. 

And Jehovah God made the man out of dust from the earth and breathed [/blew] life-breath into his nose, and the man was [/became] a living creature. 

And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, toward the East, and there he placed the Man that he [had] made.

And Jehovah God made grow from the earth every tree that is beautiful to look upon [cenien, ""for seeing"", dative] and good to eat from [lit. ""good for eating from it""], and also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil.  

There was a river that went out from Eden to give water to the garden, and from there it was parted into four streams. 

The name of the first [river] is Pishon [Hebrew: Pîshôn]; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Havíla [Chawîlâ], where there is gold. 

And the gold of that land is good. There are also fragrant gum and onyx stone. 

And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Cush. 

And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is the one that goes east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

And Jehovah God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it [lit. work in it] and watch [over] it

But from the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil do not eat, for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die. 

And Jehovah God said: ""It is not good that the man is lonely. I will make him a helper that is like him."" 

Jehovah God made out of earth all the animals of the field and all the birds of heaven, and he lead them to the man to see what he called [/would call] them. What [lit. (that) which] the man called any living creature, it was (to be) its name. 

And the man named all the beasts and the birds of heaven and all wild animals, but for Man he did not find a helper that was like him.

Then Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and filled [up] with flesh.

And Jehovah God made the rib that he took from the man into a woman, and he lead her to the man. 

Then the man said: ""This time it is bones of my bones and flesh of my flesh! This one will be called Woman, for from Man she was taken."" 

Therefore [lit. thus] a man will leave [lit. pass from] his father and his mother and stick to his wife, and they will be(come) one flesh. 

They were naked, the man and his wife, but they were not ashamed. ",Helge Kare Fauskanger,1

",Quenta Silmarillion Fragment: 'Of the beginning of days',"In the beginning of the days 

It is said within the wise ones that the firts of the wars began before the creation of Arda was achieved, before nothing had walked or grown on the surface of the Earth, and long Melkor was victorious.

But in the middle of this war, a courageous and powerful spirit came like a support to the Valar, from the end of the sky knowing the battle in the Little Earth, and Arda resounded by the echoes of his laugh.

Thus came Tulkas the Strong, his rage is like rage of the sky preceeded by dark clouds.
Melkor gone away from his joyful fury and abandonned Arda, and peace long lasted.

Tulkas abode on the Earth and was like the Valar of Arda, and Melkor stood in the outer Darkness.

His hatred of Tulkas was everlasting.
In this time, the Valar shaped the seas and the lands and the mountains, then Yavanna sowed the seeds she had create a long time ago.

Then, for the fires were controled or abandonned under the firts hills, the light was lacking.


By the request of Yavanna, Aule carried in the middle of the seas two large lamps he had made, for them to ligh the Middle Earth.


Varda filled them, Manwe lighted them and the Valar fixed them upon large pillars, higher than all the montagne that remained for us.

The first was raised in the North of Middle earth, its name was Illuin, the second in the south, Ormal, and the light of the Valar's lamps covered down the earth where everything shined like a day with no end.

'Then, the seeds sowed by Yavanna springed and sprouted swiftly, a crowd of things great and little raised on the earth, herbs and mosses and tall ferns, and tress crowned by clouds like living mountains which roots dived in the green twilight.'


'Animals came and dwelled in the valleys, in the rivers and in the lakes, and gone through the shade of the forests.'

'No flower had sprouted yet, no bird had sung, for these things waited for their hour in the heart of Yavanna, but she had though of abundance, and nowhere more rich (than) in the middle of the Earth, where the rays of the two lamps met and jointed.'

'In the great lake, on the isle of Almaren, in the time everything was new, in the time the new greenness was like an enchantment to the eyes of its creators, the Valar made their first dwelling, and longtime were fully happy about that.'

'It happened in this time that the Valar rested from their labours and looked at the growth and the expansion of the things they had though then created, Manwe established a great fest to which the Valar and their host came by his call.

'But Aule and Tulkas were lessened, for they served everybody by the skills of the first and the strenght of the second, pauseless and restless.


'And Melkor knew everything made, having secretly friends and spies within the Maiar which had fallen under his law.'

'Far away in the Darkness, he was hateful, greedy toward the works of his brothers which he had wanted under his authority.'

'Then out of the outermost limits of Ea he gethered the spirits kept for his service and he though he was strong.'


'Thinking his hour come, he approached toward Arda, he looked at it by his eyes and the vision of the Earth in its spring filled him with a new hatred.'

She took the silver dews from the vats of Telperion, and therewith she made new stars and brighter against the coming of the Firstborn; wherefore she whose name out of the deeps of time and the labours of Ea was Tintallë, the Kindler, was called after by the Elves Elentári, Queen of the Stars.

 ",Quenta Silmarillion Fragment: 'Of the ruin of Beleriand',"Battle Between Fingolfin and Morgoth

Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed-him to) the full downfall [of] the Noldor, and the downfall beyond repair [of] all houses-their; and from wrath and despair Rochallor-upon great horse-his got-he and departed alone and none were able to stop-him.  Passed-he over [the] Anfauglith like [a] wind in the dust, and all that beheld issuing-his departed thinking Oromë himself was come; for great rage was him-upon so eyes-his shone like the eyes the Valar-of.  And so came-he to Angband’s gates and sounded-he horn-his, and beat again upon the doorway and dared Morgoth to single war.  And Morgoth came.

That was the last time in those wars that passed-he the doorway [of] stronghold-his, and it is said that he answered not the dare [of] free will; but yet might-his was greatest [of] all things in this world alone [of] the Valar fear-he knew.  But-he could not deny the dare in front [of] commanders-his; for the stones rang from the high-music [of] Fingolfin’s horn, and voice-his came keen and clean down to the deeps [of] Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven and lord [of] slaves.  And so Morgoth came, ascending slowly from-his underground throneand the sound [of] feet-his was like [the] noise of a storm underground. And forth-issued-he clad in black armour; and stood before [the] King like [a] tower, iron-crowned, and might shield-his, token not carven, cast a shadow over him like [a] dark cloud.  But Fingolfin gleamed

Then Morgoth raised Grond [the] Hammer [of] Hell, and thrust it down like lightning.  But Fingolfin sprang away, and Grond rent [a] mighty pit in the earth, wherein mist and fire danced.  Many times Morgoth essayed to beat-him and each time Fingolfin leaped away, like lightning from under [a] dark cloud; and wounded-he Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave [a] shout [of] agony whereat the hosts of Angband fell on their faces in fear; and the shouts in the Northlands.

But then the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down shield-his-upon-him.  Three times crumbled down he was, and three times rose again and bore up broken shield-his and cloven helmet.  But the earth was all rent and pitted all round him, and fell-he backward-before the feet [of] Morgoth; and Morgoth set-his left foor on neck-his, and the burden [of] it was like [a] small hill.  And yet with final and hopeless stroke-his Fingolfin hewed, the foot with Ringil, and the blood forth-flooded black and smoking and filled the pits [of] Grond.

Like this died Fingolfin, High King [of the] Noldor, most brave and valiant [of the] Elven-kings [of] old.  The orcs made no festival [of] the war before the gate; and the Eldar sing not [of] it for sadness-theirs extends deep.

Account of the Valar and Maiar according to the lore of the Eldar. 
In the beginning Eru, the One, who in the Elvish tongue is named Ilúvatar, made the Ainur of his thought: and they made a great Music before him. In this Music the World was begun; for Ilúvatar made visible the song of the Ainur, and they beheld it as light in the darkness. And many among them became enamoured of its beauty, and of its history which they saw beginning and unfolding as in a vision. Therefore Ilúvatar gave to their vision Being, and set it amid the Void, and the Secret Fire was sent to burn at the heart of the World; and it was called Eä. Then those of the Ainur who desired it arose and entered into the World, at the beginning of Time; and it was their task to achieve it, and by their labours to fulfil the vision which they had seen. Long they laboured in the regions of Eä, which are vast beyond the thought of Elves and Men, until in the time appointed was made Arda, the Kingdom of Earth. Then they put on the raiment of Earth and descended into it, and dwelt therein ",Translated by Ryszard Derdzinski,1

",THE LAY OF LEITHIAN,"I. Of Thingol In Doriath
A king there was in days of old:
ere Men yet walked upon the mould
his power was reared in caverns' shade,
his hand was over glen and glade.
Of leaves his crown, his mantle green,
his silver lances long and keen;
the starlight in his shield was caught,
ere moon was made or sun was wrought.
In after-days, when to the shore
of Middle-earth from Valinor
the Elven-hosts in might returned,
and banners flew and beacons burned,
when kings of Eldamar went by
in strength of war, beneath the sky
then still his silver trumpets blew
when sun was young and moon was new.
Afar then in Beleriand,
in Doriath's beleaguered land,
King Thingol sat on guarded throne
in many-pillared halls of stone:
there beryl, pearl, and opal pale,
and metal wrought like fishes' mail,
buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
and gleaming spears were laid in hoard:
all these he had and counted small,
for clearer than all wealth in hall,
and fairer than are born to. Men,
a daughter had he, Lúthien. 

Of Lúthien the Beloved 

Such lissom limbs no more shall run
on the green earth beneath the sun;
so fair a maid no more shall be
from dawn to dusk, from sun to sea.
Her robe was blue as summer skies,
but grey as evening were her eyes;
her mantle sewn with lilies fair,
but dark as shadow was her hair.
Her feet were swift as bird on wing,
her laughter merry as the spring;
the slender willow the bowing reed,
the fragrance of a flowering mead,
the light upon the leaves of trees,
the voice of water, more than these
her beauty was and blissfulness,
her glory and her loveliness. ",Translated by Diego Sebastian Bao and Tandra Chu,1

Warmth has passed from the world. Stop, my legs! No more today.
The dust swirls above my head, my sinews shake a bit,
both rest then. The Sun crumbles, and floats tired beyond the mountains.
Stars icily glitter in the sky with their cruel light.
A sad vision of my self long years ago (or was it ages?)
trembles in the air among the trees. I shut my eyes.
It is enough to see the end of the journey all the time. It dangles
in the rear of my mind every day. Rest,
my mind, rest! Nothing remains but resolve.
They say, the Elves praise the stars. I myself dread
their endless glare, for my will collapses
under that cold perfection. The words, my message
to utter have abandoned me when the first faint glitter
of fear fell on my head. The dire message,
to tell the Valar that life is defeated, all
the Elves are gone, the Dwarves lie dead
deep under rocks too heavy to heave,
and countless Morgoths have arisen. Perhaps
it is proper that my tongue is knotted
for when I say the words, the roots of the world
will surely crumble crying, and the Void covers all.

But alas! still
the ship waits there in that harbour far away, that
I will never find. Or so it seems.

And noon-in gold-of;

When woodland halls are,
Green and cool and wind [is] West-in,
Come back to me!
Come back to me and say land-my is best!

And burn brown berry;
When straw is gold and ear is white,
And harvest comes village-to;
When honey flow, and apple swells,
With wind West-in;
Stay-I here beneath Sun,
Because land-my is best!

to have safety in unsafe time,

But not all [the] hope is lost forever,
and the anger of the Mighty is not without end.
Above the malice of Quendi is their faithfullness

is nobody of the Elven-folk sons.

Night is falling; you have come to journey's end
Sleep now and dream of the ones who came before
They are calling from across a distant shore
Why do you weep? What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms, you're only sleeping

 

What can you see on the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the Sea a pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn to silver glass
A light on the water, all souls pass

Through shadows falling out of memory and time
Don't say we have come now to the end
White shores are calling, you and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms, just sleeping

Loneliness at the Lone Island,
Beyond the many-leafed spring,
And rustle of reed, and leaf
Dry, flying from the sky.

In the morning - snow over the sleeping sea
Will melt in misty air,
And you will see a holy dream
For recalling lost knowledge.

O guard of Silmarils,
Onto road fiery-red
On a pale horse,
Whose name is Death -
To fly far,
To the West of the Sky,
From dear Arda.

Your empty sheath
And broken sword
Will sleep in the waters,
That will cover the dale.
Like a golden gift,
Your broken body
Are you giving to lands
That you were protecting.

Grey sands flow about this place.
The Sea sweeps upon it's barren rocks.
In the West the World drops off into the abyss
and the stars cry for her death.
 
Darkness rules here;
Silent in his glory.
For here is the place where spirits come
 to escape the torment of Time.

To the East rise the mountains;
Taller than the World
And their shadows cover the ocean in gloom.
The last waves
crash silently
beyond the Sunset.

Here I am, mourning:
I shall watch the West
that is beyond the West,
into the Void,
and dream
of oblivion.
