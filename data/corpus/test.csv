him before aught else was made. And he spoke to them, propounding to them
themes of music; and they sang before him, and he was glad. But for a long
while they sang only each alone, or but few together, while the rest hearkened;
for each comprehended only that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he

",Genesis (Chapitre 2),"Thus heaven and earth and all of their army were completed [lit. finished].

And on the seventh day God concluded his work that he [had] made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he [had] made.  

And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, for on it God rested from all his work that he (had) created and made.

This is the story of heaven and earth when they were created, on the day that Jehovah God made heaven and earth. 

There was not yet any bush on the field on earth, and plants still did not grow, for Jehovah God [had] not made rain fall upon earth, and there was no man to cultivate [lit. work on] the field.

But a mist rose from the earth, and it gave water to the entire surface of the earth. 

And Jehovah God made the man out of dust from the earth and breathed [/blew] life-breath into his nose, and the man was [/became] a living creature. 

And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, toward the East, and there he placed the Man that he [had] made.

And Jehovah God made grow from the earth every tree that is beautiful to look upon [cenien, ""for seeing"", dative] and good to eat from [lit. ""good for eating from it""], and also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil.  

There was a river that went out from Eden to give water to the garden, and from there it was parted into four streams. 

The name of the first [river] is Pishon [Hebrew: Pîshôn]; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Havíla [Chawîlâ], where there is gold. 

And the gold of that land is good. There are also fragrant gum and onyx stone. 

And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around all the land (of) Cush. 

And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is the one that goes east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

And Jehovah God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it [lit. work in it] and watch [over] it

But from the tree of (the) knowledge of good and evil do not eat, for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die. 

And Jehovah God said: ""It is not good that the man is lonely. I will make him a helper that is like him."" 

Jehovah God made out of earth all the animals of the field and all the birds of heaven, and he lead them to the man to see what he called [/would call] them. What [lit. (that) which] the man called any living creature, it was (to be) its name. 

And the man named all the beasts and the birds of heaven and all wild animals, but for Man he did not find a helper that was like him.

Then Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and filled [up] with flesh.

And Jehovah God made the rib that he took from the man into a woman, and he lead her to the man. 

Then the man said: ""This time it is bones of my bones and flesh of my flesh! This one will be called Woman, for from Man she was taken."" 

Therefore [lit. thus] a man will leave [lit. pass from] his father and his mother and stick to his wife, and they will be(come) one flesh. 

They were naked, the man and his wife, but they were not ashamed. ",Helge Kare Fauskanger,1

Íre roitalte le osto sinasse, uşa hyananna, an násie quetin lenna: Laume telyauvalde i rinde ostoron Israélo nó i Atanyondo tuluva.",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 10,"And he summoned the twelve disciples and gave to them power over unclean spirits, for them to throw them out, and for them to heal every disease and every ailing condition.

2 [The] names of the twelve disciples are these: First Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, 3 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, Jacob the brother of Alpheus and Thaddeus, 4 Simon the Cananean and Judas Iscariot, who after gave him over.

5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these commands: “Do not go on the road to the [gentile] nations, and do not come into a Samaritan city. 6 Instead [i mende 'in the place'], go to the lost sheep from the house of Israel! 7 While you go, make known the message, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal sick ones, raise dead ones, cleanse skin-diseased ones, throw out demons! You have received [it] for nothing, give [it] for nothing! 9 Do not put gold or silver or copper in your belt 10 or bring a food-pouch for the journey, or two tunics, or shoes or a staff, for [the one] who works is worthy of his food.

In every city or village into which you come, find out who in it is worthy, and remain there until you go away. 12 When you come into the house, greet it, 13 and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you. 14 Whenever anyone does not receive you or listens to your words, when you go away form that house or from that city, shake the dust from your feet [dual]. 15 Truly I say to you: The Day of Judgement will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for that city!

16 Behold! I send you like sheep among wolves. Therefore be intelligent like serpents and guiltless like doves. 17 Watch yourselves against men, for they will give you over to tribunals and will flay you in their synagogues. 18 You will be led before governors and kings concernin me, as a witness to them and to the nations. 19 But when they give you over, do not be troubled about how or what you are to say, for [that] which you are to say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For [the ones] that speak are not only you, but your Father's Spirit that speaks by you. 21 Furthermore, brother will give brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against their parents [dual] and will cause their [dual] death. 22 And you will be hated by all concerning my name, but who endures to the end, he will he saved. 23 When they pursue you in this city, flee to another, for truly I say to you: By no means will you complete the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man shall come.

24 A disciple is not above [the one] who instructs him, or a slave above his lord. 25 It suffices for the disciple if he becomes like [the one] who instructs him, and the slave like his lord. If people called the householder Beelzebul, how much more will they call the people of his house so?

26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. 27 [That] which I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and [that] which you hear being whispered, make it known from the tops of the houses. 28 And not do fear [those] those that kills the body but cannot kill the soul; sooner [or, rather] fear [the one] that can undo soul and body alike in Gehenna. 29 But are not two sparrows sold for a piece of copper? And yet one among them [dual] does not fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But also [or, even] all the hairs on your head are counted. 31 Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.

32 Therefore everyone that confesses me before men, I as well will confess before my father who is in heaven; 33 but anyone that denies me before men, I as well will deny before my Father who is in heaven. 34 Do not think that I have come to put peace on earth; I have not come to put peace [here], but a sword. 35 For I came to cause splits: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against the mother of her husband; 36 and a man's enemies are the people of his house. 37 If a person's father or mother is dearer to him than I [am], he is not worthy of me; and if a person's son or daughter is dearer to him than me, he is not worthy of me. 38 And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me. 39 [The] one that finds his life, to him it shall be lost, but the person whose life becomes lost for my sake [lit. for my good], will find it.

40 [He] that receives you receives also me, and [he] that receives me receives also the one who sent me. 41 [The one] that receives a prophet since he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and [the one] that receives a just man since he is just, will receive a just man's reward. 42 And anyone that gives to a person among these small ones only a cup of cold water since he is a disciple – truly I say to you, his reward will by no means be lost to him.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

In every city or village into which you come, find out who in it is worthy, and remain there until you go away. 12 When you come into the house, greet it, 13 and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you. 14 Whenever anyone does not receive you or listens to your words, when you go away form that house or from that city, shake the dust from your feet [dual]. 15 Truly I say to you: The Day of Judgement will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for that city!

16 Behold! I send you like sheep among wolves. Therefore be intelligent like serpents and guiltless like doves. 17 Watch yourselves against men, for they will give you over to tribunals and will flay you in their synagogues. 18 You will be led before governors and kings concernin me, as a witness to them and to the nations. 19 But when they give you over, do not be troubled about how or what you are to say, for [that] which you are to say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For [the ones] that speak are not only you, but your Father's Spirit that speaks by you. 21 Furthermore, brother will give brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against their parents [dual] and will cause their [dual] death. 22 And you will be hated by all concerning my name, but who endures to the end, he will he saved. 23 When they pursue you in this city, flee to another, for truly I say to you: By no means will you complete the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man shall come.

24 A disciple is not above [the one] who instructs him, or a slave above his lord. 25 It suffices for the disciple if he becomes like [the one] who instructs him, and the slave like his lord. If people called the householder Beelzebul, how much more will they call the people of his house so?

26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. 27 [That] which I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and [that] which you hear being whispered, make it known from the tops of the houses. 28 And not do fear [those] those that kills the body but cannot kill the soul; sooner [or, rather] fear [the one] that can undo soul and body alike in Gehenna. 29 But are not two sparrows sold for a piece of copper? And yet one among them [dual] does not fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But also [or, even] all the hairs on your head are counted. 31 Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.

32 Therefore everyone that confesses me before men, I as well will confess before my father who is in heaven; 33 but anyone that denies me before men, I as well will deny before my Father who is in heaven. 34 Do not think that I have come to put peace on earth; I have not come to put peace [here], but a sword. 35 For I came to cause splits: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against the mother of her husband; 36 and a man's enemies are the people of his house. 37 If a person's father or mother is dearer to him than I [am], he is not worthy of me; and if a person's son or daughter is dearer to him than me, he is not worthy of me. 38 And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me. 39 [The] one that finds his life, to him it shall be lost, but the person whose life becomes lost for my sake [lit. for my good], will find it.

40 [He] that receives you receives also me, and [he] that receives me receives also the one who sent me. 41 [The one] that receives a prophet since he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and [the one] that receives a just man since he is just, will receive a just man's reward. 42 And anyone that gives to a person among these small ones only a cup of cold water since he is a disciple – truly I say to you, his reward will by no means be lost to him.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

9 After he went away from there he came into their synagogue. 10 And behold! [there] was there a man having a withered hand. 11 He said to them: “Who is the man among you having a single sheep who does not, if this sheep falls into a hollow on the day of rest, take hold of it and lift it out? 13 But how much more precious than a sheep is a man! Thus [it] is allowed to do good on the day of rest!” 12 Then he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and it was renewed and was like the other hand. 14 But the Pharisees went outside and made plans about how they were going to destroy him.

15 Knowing that, Jesus went away from there. Numerous ones also followed him, and he healed all among them, 16 but he commanded them firmly that they were [Q: are] not to make him known, 17 to fulfill [lit. make true] which was said through Isaiah the Prophet, who said:

18 “Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved one, by whom my soul is pleased. I shall put my spirit in him, and justice [or, judgement] he will make known to the nations. 19 He shall not quarrel or cry, and no one will hear his voice on the roads. 20 A broken sedge he shall not crush, and a smouldering wick [urulanya = fire-thread] he shall not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory. 21 And in his name the nations shall put their hope!”

22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed person, blind and dumb, and he healed him, causing the dumb man to talk and see. 23 And all the crowd were beside themselves with wonder, and they said: “Maybe this man is the Son of David!” 24 Hearing that, the Pharisees said: “This man does not throw out the demons except by the lord of the demons, Beelzebub!” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself becomes void, and every city and house split against itself will not stand. 26 And if Satan throws out Satan, he is split against himself; then how will his kingdom stand? 27 Furthermore, if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if [it is] by God's spirit I throw out the demons, God's kingdom has indeed come to you. 29 Or how can anyone go into the house of a strong man and take his goods, if he does not firstly bind the strong man? And then he will steal the things in his house. 30 [The one] who is not with me is my enemy, ar [the one] who does not gather with me, scatters.

31 Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to Men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 For anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, to him it will be forgiven, but [as for the one] who speaks against the Holy spirit, that will not be forgiven him, in this age and the coming one alike.

38 Then some among [the] Pharisees answered him: “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you!” 39 In answer he said to them: “A wicked and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet. 40 For like Jonah was in the inward part [mitya, interior] of the big fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 41 Men from Ninive will arise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil, for they found repentance when Jonah made known his message, but behold! here is what is greater than Jonah!

Thus [it] is allowed to do good on the day of rest!” 12 Then he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and it was renewed and was like the other hand. 14 But the Pharisees went outside and made plans about how they were going to destroy him.

15 Knowing that, Jesus went away from there. Numerous ones also followed him, and he healed all among them, 16 but he commanded them firmly that they were [Q: are] not to make him known, 17 to fulfill [lit. make true] which was said through Isaiah the Prophet, who said:

18 “Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved one, by whom my soul is pleased. I shall put my spirit in him, and justice [or, judgement] he will make known to the nations. 19 He shall not quarrel or cry, and no one will hear his voice on the roads. 20 A broken sedge he shall not crush, and a smouldering wick [urulanya = fire-thread] he shall not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory. 21 And in his name the nations shall put their hope!”

22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed person, blind and dumb, and he healed him, causing the dumb man to talk and see. 23 And all the crowd were beside themselves with wonder, and they said: “Maybe this man is the Son of David!” 24 Hearing that, the Pharisees said: “This man does not throw out the demons except by the lord of the demons, Beelzebub!” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself becomes void, and every city and house split against itself will not stand. 26 And if Satan throws out Satan, he is split against himself; then how will his kingdom stand? 27 Furthermore, if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if [it is] by God's spirit I throw out the demons, God's kingdom has indeed come to you. 29 Or how can anyone go into the house of a strong man and take his goods, if he does not firstly bind the strong man? And then he will steal the things in his house. 30 [The one] who is not with me is my enemy, ar [the one] who does not gather with me, scatters.

31 Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to Men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 For anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, to him it will be forgiven, but [as for the one] who speaks against the Holy spirit, that will not be forgiven him, in this age and the coming one alike.

33 Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.

34 Offspring of snakes, how can you say good things, you who are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good man brings good things from his good treasure, but the bad [olca, wicked] man brings wicked things from his bad treasure. 36 I say to you that concerning every saying that men say that is not beneficial, they will answer on the Day of Judgement, 37 for by your own words you will be judged [to be] righteous, and by your own words you will be judged evil!”

38 Then some among [the] Pharisees answered him: “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you!” 39 In answer he said to them: “A wicked and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet. 40 For like Jonah was in the inward part [mitya, interior] of the big fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 41 Men from Ninive will arise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil, for they found repentance when Jonah made known his message, but behold! here is what is greater than Jonah!

42 The queen of the South will rise in the judgment with this generation and will judge it evil, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold! here is what is greater than Solomon.

43 When an unclean spirit comes out from a man, it passes through dry places seeking a place of rest, but it does not find [any]. 44 Then it says: “I will return to my house from which I moved,” and coming to it, it finds the house empty, but clean and adorned. 45 Then it goes away and brings with itself seven other spirits, more wicked than itself, and having entered they dwell there, and that man's final state is worse than the first! So it will be also for this wicked generation!”

46 As he was still speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and his brothers stood on the outside and wished to speak with him. 47 And someone said to him: “Behold! Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to speak with you!” 48 In answer he said to [the one] who spoke to him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 49 And reaching out with his hand towards his disciples he said: “Behold my mother and my brothers! 50 Anyone who does the will of my father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother!”",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

His disciples were hungry and started to pick heads or grain to eat. 2 And seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Behold! Your disiciples do what is not alloewd to do on the day of rest!” 3 He said to them: “Have you not read about what David did when he and the men with him were hungry. 4 He went into God's house and ate the breads of showing, which were not allowed food for him or for those that were with him, but for the priests alone? 5 Or have you not read in the Law that on the day of rest the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are without guilt? 6 But I say to you that here is [that] which is greater than the temple. 7 But if you understood what this word means: 'I want mercy, and not sacrifice', you did not judge [or, would not judge] those that are without guilt. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the day of rest!”

9 After he went away from there he came into their synagogue. 10 And behold! [there] was there a man having a withered hand. 11 He said to them: “Who is the man among you having a single sheep who does not, if this sheep falls into a hollow on the day of rest, take hold of it and lift it out? 13 But how much more precious than a sheep is a man! Thus [it] is allowed to do good on the day of rest!” 12 Then he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and it was renewed and was like the other hand. 14 But the Pharisees went outside and made plans about how they were going to destroy him.

15 Knowing that, Jesus went away from there. Numerous ones also followed him, and he healed all among them, 16 but he commanded them firmly that they were [Q: are] not to make him known, 17 to fulfill [lit. make true] which was said through Isaiah the Prophet, who said:

18 “Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved one, by whom my soul is pleased. I shall put my spirit in him, and justice [or, judgement] he will make known to the nations. 19 He shall not quarrel or cry, and no one will hear his voice on the roads. 20 A broken sedge he shall not crush, and a smouldering wick [urulanya = fire-thread] he shall not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory. 21 And in his name the nations shall put their hope!”

22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed person, blind and dumb, and he healed him, causing the dumb man to talk and see. 23 And all the crowd were beside themselves with wonder, and they said: “Maybe this man is the Son of David!” 24 Hearing that, the Pharisees said: “This man does not throw out the demons except by the lord of the demons, Beelzebub!” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself becomes void, and every city and house split against itself will not stand. 26 And if Satan throws out Satan, he is split against himself; then how will his kingdom stand? 27 Furthermore, if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if [it is] by God's spirit I throw out the demons, God's kingdom has indeed come to you. 29 Or how can anyone go into the house of a strong man and take his goods, if he does not firstly bind the strong man? And then he will steal the things in his house. 30 [The one] who is not with me is my enemy, ar [the one] who does not gather with me, scatters.

31 Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to Men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 For anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, to him it will be forgiven, but [as for the one] who speaks against the Holy spirit, that will not be forgiven him, in this age and the coming one alike.

Thus [it] is allowed to do good on the day of rest!” 12 Then he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and it was renewed and was like the other hand. 14 But the Pharisees went outside and made plans about how they were going to destroy him.

15 Knowing that, Jesus went away from there. Numerous ones also followed him, and he healed all among them, 16 but he commanded them firmly that they were [Q: are] not to make him known, 17 to fulfill [lit. make true] which was said through Isaiah the Prophet, who said:

18 “Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved one, by whom my soul is pleased. I shall put my spirit in him, and justice [or, judgement] he will make known to the nations. 19 He shall not quarrel or cry, and no one will hear his voice on the roads. 20 A broken sedge he shall not crush, and a smouldering wick [urulanya = fire-thread] he shall not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory. 21 And in his name the nations shall put their hope!”

22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed person, blind and dumb, and he healed him, causing the dumb man to talk and see. 23 And all the crowd were beside themselves with wonder, and they said: “Maybe this man is the Son of David!” 24 Hearing that, the Pharisees said: “This man does not throw out the demons except by the lord of the demons, Beelzebub!” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself becomes void, and every city and house split against itself will not stand. 26 And if Satan throws out Satan, he is split against himself; then how will his kingdom stand? 27 Furthermore, if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if [it is] by God's spirit I throw out the demons, God's kingdom has indeed come to you. 29 Or how can anyone go into the house of a strong man and take his goods, if he does not firstly bind the strong man? And then he will steal the things in his house. 30 [The one] who is not with me is my enemy, ar [the one] who does not gather with me, scatters.

31 Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to Men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 For anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, to him it will be forgiven, but [as for the one] who speaks against the Holy spirit, that will not be forgiven him, in this age and the coming one alike.

33 Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.

34 Offspring of snakes, how can you say good things, you who are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good man brings good things from his good treasure, but the bad [olca, wicked] man brings wicked things from his bad treasure. 36 I say to you that concerning every saying that men say that is not beneficial, they will answer on the Day of Judgement, 37 for by your own words you will be judged [to be] righteous, and by your own words you will be judged evil!”

38 Then some among [the] Pharisees answered him: “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you!” 39 In answer he said to them: “A wicked and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet. 40 For like Jonah was in the inward part [mitya, interior] of the big fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 41 Men from Ninive will arise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil, for they found repentance when Jonah made known his message, but behold! here is what is greater than Jonah!

42 The queen of the South will rise in the judgment with this generation and will judge it evil, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold! here is what is greater than Solomon.

43 When an unclean spirit comes out from a man, it passes through dry places seeking a place of rest, but it does not find [any]. 44 Then it says: “I will return to my house from which I moved,” and coming to it, it finds the house empty, but clean and adorned. 45 Then it goes away and brings with itself seven other spirits, more wicked than itself, and having entered they dwell there, and that man's final state is worse than the first! So it will be also for this wicked generation!”

46 As he was still speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and his brothers stood on the outside and wished to speak with him. 47 And someone said to him: “Behold! Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to speak with you!” 48 In answer he said to [the one] who spoke to him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 49 And reaching out with his hand towards his disciples he said: “Behold my mother and my brothers! 50 Anyone who does the will of my father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother!”",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

Ye same hlaru, nai isse hlára!”",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 13,"On that day Jesus, after he went from the house, was sitting beside the sea, 2 and great crowds gathered to him. Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 While he was sowing some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them. 5 Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil. 6 But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them. 8 But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty. 9 Who has ears, may he be hearing!

10 And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?” 11 In reply he said: “To you it has been given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given. 12 For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand, 14 and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see. 15 For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”

16 But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear. 17 And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see [the things] that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.

18 Therefore, you hear [imperative!] the comparison about the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is [that] which was sown by the road. 20 And [the one] that was sown upon the rock, that is [the one] who hears the word and receives it in joy. 21 And yet he does not have [any] root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment. 22 And [the one] that was sown among the thorns, this is [the one] who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and he is without fruit.

23 And [the one] who was sown on the good earth, this is [the one] who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.”

24 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away. 26 When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up. 27 Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?” 28 He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go [= do you wish us to go] to gather them?” 29 He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants. 30 Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”

31 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has become a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”

33 Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”

34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in comparisons, and without a comparison he did not speak to them, 35 to make true [that] which was said through the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth in comparisons; I will make known things hidden from the foundation!”

36 Then, after sending the crowds away, he went into the boat. And his disciples came to him and said: “Let us understand the comparison about the worthless plants in the field!” 37 In answer he said: “[The one] who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; 38 the field is the world, and the good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom, but the worthless plands are the sons of the Wicked One. 39 The enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age, the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore, as when the worthless plants are being gathered and burnt by fire, so it will be at the conclusion of the age: 42 The Son of Man will send his angles, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall and the people that break the law, 42 and they will thrown them into the oven of fire. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth. 43 Then the righteous ones will shine like the Sun, in their Father's kingdom. [The one] who has hears, let him be hearing!

44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and for [-nen] his joy he goes away and sells the things that he has, and trades to himself that field.

45 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a tradesman seeking good pearls: 46 After finding one pearl that was most precious, he went away and sold everything that he had and traded it to himself.

47 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net, thrown into the sea and gathering fishes of every kind. 48 When it was full, they pulled it up onto the beach and sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but the worthless ones they threw away. 49 Thus it will be at the conclusion of the age: The angels will go forth and will separate the wicked from the righteous, 50 and they will throw them into the fiery oven. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth.

51 Do you understand all these things?” They said to him: “Yes!” 52 Then he said to them: “Therefore every scribe, instructed about the kingdom of heaven, is like a man, a householder, who brings out from his treasure things new and old!”

53 And then, after Jesus completed these comparisons, he crossed land from there. 54 And when he came to his home territory, he instructed them in their synagogue. Thus they were filled with wonder and said: “From where did this man receive this wisdom and these mighty deeds? Is this not the carpenter's son? Is his mother not Mary, and his brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Juda? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man receive all these things?” 57 Therefore they were angry with [-nna, against] him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet does not lack honor except in his home territory and in his house!” 58 And he did not do numerous mighty deeds there, since they lacked faith.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1
