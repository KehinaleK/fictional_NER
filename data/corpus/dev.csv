But the Gates are closed,

The first herald calls alone;
A voice in the twilight.
A flame burns beyond the Gates
and the stars tremble.

Fire dances upon the mountaintops
for Dawn is coming
and her song rings about the peaks.

Now the Gates open,
and forth the glory pours.
Arien fire-eyed is riding
through the bright rain singing,
and by her song the night is broken.

Incandescent is the East: The Gates burn
with holy fire; born of gold-flower.
Copper trumpets herald the Brilliant One

Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 While he was sowing some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them. 5 Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil. 6 But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them. 8 But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty. 9 Who has ears, may he be hearing!

10 And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?” 11 In reply he said: “To you it has been given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given. 12 For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand, 14 and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see. 15 For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”

16 But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear. 17 And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see [the things] that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.

18 Therefore, you hear [imperative!] the comparison about the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is [that] which was sown by the road. 20 And [the one] that was sown upon the rock, that is [the one] who hears the word and receives it in joy. 21 And yet he does not have [any] root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment. 22 And [the one] that was sown among the thorns, this is [the one] who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and he is without fruit.

23 And [the one] who was sown on the good earth, this is [the one] who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.”

24 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away. 26 When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up. 27 Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?” 28 He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go [= do you wish us to go] to gather them?” 29 He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants. 30 Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”

31 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has become a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”

33 Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”

34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in comparisons, and without a comparison he did not speak to them, 35 to make true [that] which was said through the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth in comparisons; I will make known things hidden from the foundation!”

36 Then, after sending the crowds away, he went into the boat. And his disciples came to him and said: “Let us understand the comparison about the worthless plants in the field!” 37 In answer he said: “[The one] who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; 38 the field is the world, and the good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom, but the worthless plands are the sons of the Wicked One. 39 The enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age, the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore, as when the worthless plants are being gathered and burnt by fire, so it will be at the conclusion of the age: 42 The Son of Man will send his angles, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall and the people that break the law, 42 and they will thrown them into the oven of fire. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth. 43 Then the righteous ones will shine like the Sun, in their Father's kingdom. [The one] who has hears, let him be hearing!

44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and for [-nen] his joy he goes away and sells the things that he has, and trades to himself that field.

45 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a tradesman seeking good pearls: 46 After finding one pearl that was most precious, he went away and sold everything that he had and traded it to himself.

47 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net, thrown into the sea and gathering fishes of every kind. 48 When it was full, they pulled it up onto the beach and sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but the worthless ones they threw away. 49 Thus it will be at the conclusion of the age: The angels will go forth and will separate the wicked from the righteous, 50 and they will throw them into the fiery oven. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth.

51 Do you understand all these things?” They said to him: “Yes!” 52 Then he said to them: “Therefore every scribe, instructed about the kingdom of heaven, is like a man, a householder, who brings out from his treasure things new and old!”

53 And then, after Jesus completed these comparisons, he crossed land from there. 54 And when he came to his home territory, he instructed them in their synagogue. Thus they were filled with wonder and said: “From where did this man receive this wisdom and these mighty deeds? Is this not the carpenter's son? Is his mother not Mary, and his brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Juda? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man receive all these things?” 57 Therefore they were angry with [-nna, against] him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet does not lack honor except in his home territory and in his house!” 58 And he did not do numerous mighty deeds there, since they lacked faith.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1

Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 While he was sowing some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them. 5 Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil. 6 But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them. 8 But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty. 9 Who has ears, may he be hearing!

10 And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?” 11 In reply he said: “To you it has been given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given. 12 For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand, 14 and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see. 15 For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”

16 But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear. 17 And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see [the things] that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.

18 Therefore, you hear [imperative!] the comparison about the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is [that] which was sown by the road. 20 And [the one] that was sown upon the rock, that is [the one] who hears the word and receives it in joy. 21 And yet he does not have [any] root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment. 22 And [the one] that was sown among the thorns, this is [the one] who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and he is without fruit.

23 And [the one] who was sown on the good earth, this is [the one] who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.”

24 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away. 26 When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up. 27 Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?” 28 He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go [= do you wish us to go] to gather them?” 29 He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants. 30 Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”

31 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has become a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”

33 Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”

Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 While he was sowing some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them. 5 Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil. 6 But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them. 8 But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty. 9 Who has ears, may he be hearing!

10 And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?” 11 In reply he said: “To you it has been given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given. 12 For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand, 14 and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see. 15 For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”

16 But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear. 17 And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see [the things] that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.

18 Therefore, you hear [imperative!] the comparison about the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is [that] which was sown by the road. 20 And [the one] that was sown upon the rock, that is [the one] who hears the word and receives it in joy. 21 And yet he does not have [any] root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment. 22 And [the one] that was sown among the thorns, this is [the one] who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and he is without fruit.

23 And [the one] who was sown on the good earth, this is [the one] who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.”

24 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away. 26 When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up. 27 Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?” 28 He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go [= do you wish us to go] to gather them?” 29 He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants. 30 Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”

31 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has become a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”

33 Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”

34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in comparisons, and without a comparison he did not speak to them, 35 to make true [that] which was said through the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth in comparisons; I will make known things hidden from the foundation!”

Mal Yésus quente téna: “Erutercáno ua pene laitie hequa vehteryasse ar coaryasse!” Ar uas carne tasse rimbe taure cardali, pan pennelte savie.",Gospel of Matthew CHAPTER 13,"On that day Jesus, after he went from the house, was sitting beside the sea, 2 and great crowds gathered to him. Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 While he was sowing some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them. 5 Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil. 6 But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them. 8 But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty. 9 Who has ears, may he be hearing!

10 And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?” 11 In reply he said: “To you it has been given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given. 12 For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand, 14 and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see. 15 For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”

16 But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear. 17 And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see [the things] that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.

18 Therefore, you hear [imperative!] the comparison about the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is [that] which was sown by the road. 20 And [the one] that was sown upon the rock, that is [the one] who hears the word and receives it in joy. 21 And yet he does not have [any] root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment. 22 And [the one] that was sown among the thorns, this is [the one] who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and he is without fruit.

23 And [the one] who was sown on the good earth, this is [the one] who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.”

24 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away. 26 When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up. 27 Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?” 28 He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go [= do you wish us to go] to gather them?” 29 He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants. 30 Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”

31 Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has become a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”

33 Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”

34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in comparisons, and without a comparison he did not speak to them, 35 to make true [that] which was said through the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth in comparisons; I will make known things hidden from the foundation!”

36 Then, after sending the crowds away, he went into the boat. And his disciples came to him and said: “Let us understand the comparison about the worthless plants in the field!” 37 In answer he said: “[The one] who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; 38 the field is the world, and the good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom, but the worthless plands are the sons of the Wicked One. 39 The enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age, the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore, as when the worthless plants are being gathered and burnt by fire, so it will be at the conclusion of the age: 42 The Son of Man will send his angles, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall and the people that break the law, 42 and they will thrown them into the oven of fire. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth. 43 Then the righteous ones will shine like the Sun, in their Father's kingdom. [The one] who has hears, let him be hearing!

44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and for [-nen] his joy he goes away and sells the things that he has, and trades to himself that field.

45 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a tradesman seeking good pearls: 46 After finding one pearl that was most precious, he went away and sold everything that he had and traded it to himself.

47 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net, thrown into the sea and gathering fishes of every kind. 48 When it was full, they pulled it up onto the beach and sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but the worthless ones they threw away. 49 Thus it will be at the conclusion of the age: The angels will go forth and will separate the wicked from the righteous, 50 and they will throw them into the fiery oven. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth.

51 Do you understand all these things?” They said to him: “Yes!” 52 Then he said to them: “Therefore every scribe, instructed about the kingdom of heaven, is like a man, a householder, who brings out from his treasure things new and old!”

53 And then, after Jesus completed these comparisons, he crossed land from there. 54 And when he came to his home territory, he instructed them in their synagogue. Thus they were filled with wonder and said: “From where did this man receive this wisdom and these mighty deeds? Is this not the carpenter's son? Is his mother not Mary, and his brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Juda? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man receive all these things?” 57 Therefore they were angry with [-nna, against] him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet does not lack honor except in his home territory and in his house!” 58 And he did not do numerous mighty deeds there, since they lacked faith.",Helge Kåre Fauskanger,1
